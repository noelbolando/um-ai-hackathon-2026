# ✦ Curio ✦ 
## Your Academic Pathfinder

This project was born out from the 2026 University of Michigan AI Hackathon
Check out our [Live Demo!](https://curioapp.streamlit.app/)

Curios is an AI-powered personal learning coach that helps make the most out of college by curating the most relevant courses, faculty, and campus opportunities aligned with their goals. Given a learning goal — like *"I want to break into consulting"* or *"I want to understand machine learning"* — Curio searches across thousands of courses, faculty profiles, and campus events to surface the most relevant resources and explain why each one fits.

---

## What It Does

When a student enters a learning goal, Curio:

1. **Extracts a search query** from the goal using an LLM
2. **Searches semantically** across courses, faculty, and campus events using ChromaDB vector search
3. **Explains each result** — why this course, professor, or event helps achieve the specific goal
4. **Generates a unified response** from an AI advisor tying everything together
5. **Remembers the conversation** so follow-up queries build on previous ones

## Tech Stack

Curio is a multi-Agentic system that utilizes RAG-based workflows to generate content to meet user requests.

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Streamlit |
| LLM | Groq API (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) |
| Embeddings | `sentence-transformers` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) |
| Vector DB | ChromaDB (persistent) |
| Parallelism | `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent LLM calls |
