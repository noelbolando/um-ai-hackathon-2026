EAS 501.002,Water Law,Winter 2025,3,,"Water is arguably the world's most precious resource, and learning water law is vital to understanding the present and future of water access. Generally, water law refers to the laws that govern ownership, access to, and management of water contained in rivers, lakes, and aquifers, as well as the land that immediately underlies those water resources. Specifically, this class will cover: the distinction in surface water interests between the riparian doctrine in the wetter eastern United States and the prior appropriation doctrine in the more arid western United States; groundwater interests in shared aquifers; the public trust doctrine; water inequality; dams and watercourse management; takings claims; federal water interests; interstate compacts; Supreme Court original jurisdiction over interstate water disputes; water rights in Indian country; transnational management of shared surface waters and aquifers; and the common enemy doctrine governing water redirection. In the examination of those topics, we will consider relationships of water law to issues of development and economic policy."
EAS 501.003,"Organizing: People, Power, and Change",Winter 2025,3,,"Do you want to learn how to make lasting changes on a larger scale than one person can normally achieve? Organizers do that by identifying, recruiting, and developing leadership; nurturing community around that leadership; and building power from the resources of that community. In this course, you learn how to do this kind of organizing in your workplace and your community. You will form leadership teams of 3 to 5 classmates based on common values, identify the constituency with which your team will work, develop a campaign strategy to make a change that constituents think is important, try to implement that strategy. Organizing is a craft: you learn by doing and you get better with practice. You will learn five core leadership practices: building public relationships, turning values into motivation through public narrative, turning resources into power by strategizing, turning intentions into effective action, and structuring organization to develop leadership, engage constituents, and achieve goals. You will also learn to coach others and to receive coaching in organizing practices."
EAS 501.004,Power Building and Community Organizing for Social Justice,Winter 2026,3,Michelle Martinez,"What is collective power? How do you build it? What is social justice? How do you achieve it? In this class students will ask the question of what it takes to build the kind of movements, and organizations, that seek to bend the arc towards justice through activism. The class will seek to understand the tactics and strategies that groups develop to build community power, how groups organize and escalate, to contend with global markets, political hierarchies, and economic and political power structures.  We will briefly look at the political framework of racial capitalism and the neoliberal project as the context through which power is wielded and against which campaigns are developed and waged. Participation is key, and students will practice “group work”, review and create a case study, and should seek to develop their own viewpoints on the phrase “theory of change”."

EAS 501.037,Sustainability and Supply Chains,Fall 2025,3,Joshua Newell,"Study of how everyday things—the food we consume, the clothes we wear, the furniture we sit on—intertwine urban dwellers with distant people, places, and spaces. The course provides theoretical and methodological approaches to understand how supply chains and networks are perpetually reconfigured by processes of (de)globalization and the role of corporations, nation-states, labor, NGOs, and consumers. The course provides understanding on efforts to make supply chains more sustainable, resilient, and humane.  Students will learn the skills necessary to track the origin of products through the supply chain, as well as methods and practices to calculate the carbon footprint of corporate supply chains, especially Scope 3 emissions."
EAS 501.040,Environmental Justice,Winter 2026,2,,"Every day with regard to the environment, decisions are made and actions are taken that disproportionately impact people of color, indigenous peoples, and the poor. Can we ever achieve environmental justice through the law? This course examines whether and how our legal system can address environmental racism and other forms of environmental injustice. After covering the history of the environmental justice movement as both a social and legal phenomenon, we will explore and assess the legal frameworks available to address environmental injustice. With regard to legal frameworks, we will spend most of our time on tort, civil rights, environmental-administrative, and land use & zoning. The environmental administrative framework will include pollution control laws (e.g. Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act), utility rate-setting, management of natural resources & public lands, and climate change. Apart from traditional legal materials, we will also read social science & public health scholarship, newspaper articles, history, philosophy, and literature."
EAS 501.042 Environmental Justice New Directions,,Winter 2026,3,Paul Mohai,"The goal of this course is to focus on current issues and likely future directions in the environmental justice field and movement. In doing so, we will examine the current state of environmental justice research and evaluate how much progress has been made to date in policy developments to address and solve the problems, as well as assess where future efforts need to be directed. We will attempt to get the perspectives of community, academic, and government leaders. Interest in environmental justice has spread to other countries around the world. The U.S., however, has been seen as the leader on this issue. Those studying environmental justice in Europe and in developing countries have relied on U.S. involvements to guide them. A comparison between environmental justice movements in the U.S. and internationally will thus also be made. At the end of the course, students should not only have a good understanding of the current state of environmental justice but also be prepared to analyze, critique, and contribute to the academic and political debates surrounding it. There are no prerequisites for this course."
EAS 501.055,"Environmental Racism, Health, and Pathways for Justice",Winter 2026,3,Heidi Hausermann,"This course examines environmental racism in historic and contemporary settings, and links environmental racism to uneven burdens of disease and ill-health. This course operates with the assertion that environmental racism is real and a lived experience for many people worldwide. We will not debate the importance of social determinants, risk factors, or behaviors. Rather, we will investigate the historical, spatial, and socio-ecological processes (e.g. racial capitalism, white settler colonialism, stigmatization) that shape environmental racism and the uneven distribution of ill health and disease. We will also examine how people mediate these dynamics and work toward healing, well-being, and justice."
EAS 501.071,Data Science for the Environment,Winter 2025,3,Kai Zhu,"Data science is rapidly changing environmental scholarship. Environmental data are growing exponentially in size and quality at an unprecedented rate. The data deluge comes with new challenges of sifting, processing, and synthesizing large and diverse sources of information. In this course, students will learn the fundamental practices of environmental informatics mainly using the R programming language. The workshop-style course is designed without the requirement of prior experience in R. The class will include environmental-related modules such as climate change, plant growth, animal predator-prey dynamics, overfishing and marine protected areas. Each module will introduce new datasets and questions, leading to new hands-on skills. Students will use these skills throughout the quarter to find an environmental-related topic, draft a proposal, search for data, perform analyses, summarize results, and complete a final paper."
EAS 501.074,Sustainable Urban Systems,Winter 2026,3,Benjamin Goldstein,"As global centers of population and economic activity, cities consume vast amounts of resources. The demand for energy, building materials, water, mobility, and consumer goods in cities fuels unequal environmental change in multiple dimensions both inside cities and at distal locations beyond their borders. At the same time, access to these resources and the essential services they provide is also grossly unequal within and between urban areas. This makes cities critical to just decarbonization and to equitably achieving a range of other societal sustainability goals. To support the necessary transition to a more sustainable urban future through policy and urban design, cities need robust metrics to track their environmental performance. This course introduces graduate students to cutting-edge methods to measure and map the stocks and flows of energy and materials in cities and their related environmental impacts. We start with an introduction to the interdisciplinary metaphor of urban metabolism – the churn of material and energy flows within and across urban boundaries – and theories of urban land teleconnections, planetary urbanization, and other multi-scalar conceptualizations of urban processes. We then review current methods to quantify the metabolism, including input-output analysis and carbon accounting protocols for cities. Students then learn how to develop bottom-up estimates of the environmental footprints of cities using methods from industrial ecology – material flow analysis, life cycle assessment, carbon footprint – and a variety of novel data sources. Solutions inspired by engineering, industrial/urban symbiosis, and allied fields will be proposed and tested to promote more sustainable cities via group projects on a case city. Course deliverables include quizzes, a midterm exam, individual papers and multimedia reflections, tutorials, and a large group project."
EAS 501.079,Communicating Climate Change,Winter 2026,3,Nathaniel Geiger,"This course provides an overview of different methods of climate change communication, with a particular focus on communication designed to promote public engagement with climate change. The class will explore public opinion on climate change, different theoretical perspectives on barriers to effective communication and public engagement with the topic, and compare and contrast the effectiveness of different methods of climate change communication across different contexts, mediums, and for different goals. This course takes a predominantly social scientific approach, meaning that we will mostly read and reflect on articles that scientifically test the effectiveness of various communication strategies."

EAS 501.083,Energy Politics and Policy,Winter 2026,3,Geoffrey Henderson,"To understand how to advance climate justice, this course introduces students to the politics and policy of the contemporary energy system, with a focus on electricity production and use. We will examine energy systems in the United States and in countries around the world at various stages of industrialization, centering fenceline communities’ perspectives. Students will learn the characteristics of energy technologies, perform the calculations necessary to compare policy options, identify key actors and interests in the energy system, and make original arguments about how the choices we make in our energy system are rooted in politics."
EAS 501.085,Speculative Landscapes: Design as Inquiry,Winter 2026,2,Lisa DuRussel,"This design seminar-studio positions landscape architecture as a tool for critical speculation and inquiry, inviting students to imagine futures that challenge the boundaries of current environmental, social, and technological paradigms. Framed around the structure of a design competition, students will investigate emerging and uncertain conditions—climate adaptation, post-industrial transformation, multispecies coexistence, and planetary change—through experimental design proposals."
EAS 501.098,Ecological Design and Planning Theory,Fall 2025,3,Joan Iverson Nassauer,"To consider how policy, design, and planning might affect human behavior to achieve more sustainable and just landscapes, this seminar will introduce and critically discuss theories about aesthetic experience of landscapes.  It will focus on everyday landscapes, drawing comparisons among cultural experiences and with well-known landscape designs.  Course readings and class discussions will draw on literature in social science, design, and philosophy of aesthetics, and importantly, students’ own experiences.  Students from all disciplines are welcomed to this seminar. “Aesthetic experience” means enjoyment of noticeable characteristics. The underlying premise for linking landscape aesthetics and human behavior is: People protect or change landscapes to make places that conform with their personal, social, and cultural aesthetic values - about nature, care, stewardship, neighborliness, and financial value.  These values and their associated landscape characteristics can be tactically employed in landscape interventions that also support more healthy, just and sustainable urban and rural landscapes. In short, to promote behavior that supports sustainable and just landscapes, use landscape characteristics give people immediate enjoyment. The course will have two activities:  First, a series of student-led discussions of required readings to establish a shared conceptual foundation for further examination; each week two or three papers from the refereed literature will be discussed. Second, discussions of topics related to individual student papers, in which students pursue their own interests.  Papers are short (less than 5000 words with references) fully referenced (APA Style) paper.  The paper will initially be produced as a draft for feedback before final submission."
EAS 501.098,Ecological Design and Planning Theory,Winter 2024,3,Joan Iverson Nassauer,"To consider how policy, design, and planning might affect human behavior to achieve more sustainable and just landscapes, this seminar will introduce and critically discuss theories about aesthetic experience of landscapes.  It will focus on everyday landscapes, drawing comparisons among cultural experiences and with well-known landscape designs.  Course readings and class discussions will draw on literature in social science, design, and philosophy of aesthetics, and importantly, students’ own experiences.  Students from all disciplines are welcomed to this seminar. “Aesthetic experience” means enjoyment of noticeable characteristics. The underlying premise for linking landscape aesthetics and human behavior is: People protect or change landscapes to make places that conform with their personal, social, and cultural aesthetic values - about nature, care, stewardship, neighborliness, and financial value.  These values and their associated landscape characteristics can be tactically employed in landscape interventions that also support more healthy, just and sustainable urban and rural landscapes. In short, to promote behavior that supports sustainable and just landscapes, use landscape characteristics give people immediate enjoyment. The course will have two activities:  First, a series of student-led discussions of required readings to establish a shared conceptual foundation for further examination; each week two or three papers from the refereed literature will be discussed.

EAS 501.107,SusDev Foundations: Cross-Cutting Issues,Fall 2025,1.5,Rajiv Ghimire,"This class will examine key cross-cutting themes of sustainability and development through the framework of sustainability science. With its focus on use-inspired, basic, interdisciplinary research, the field of sustainability science has emerged as a foundational means to think through human-environmental relationships and social-ecological systems. Key thrusts in sustainability science – to bridge the gap between science and practice and across social, ecological, and professional sciences – are central to understanding and changing the trajectories of unsustainable development in many regions and countries, societies and communities, sectors, and markets. Students taking the course will (1) learn about the core principles of sustainability science and its antecedents, and (2) focus on four cross-cutting themes relevant to sustainability: Equity and justice, adaption to shocks, and transformational change, knowledge-action relationships, and governance of complex systems. Learning goals and outcomes - Develop an understanding of key concepts in sustainability science, the ability to use them, and the capacity to understand their relationships - Identify how empirical writings apply these key concepts and the major theoretical underpinnings of sustainability science and assess and critique their use in the literature - Analyze political and institutional dimensions of sustainability - Apply concepts and framings of interest to you in creating an independent empirical case study related to one of four issues in sustainability science: 1. Equity/Justice in sustainability; 2. Knowledge to Action; 3. Adaptation, 4. Governance of social-ecological systems"

EAS 501.119,"Nature, Culture, Landscape",Winter 2026,3,Sara Ana Adlerstein Gonzalez,"Nature is no outside of ourselves; we are Nature. Culture is a mirror of who we are as a species, a society, a community; it is a barometer of health, an evolving canvas for life. Landscape is a human conception, constructed of our goals and aspirations, built from necessity, avarice, invention and imagination. This course will examine layers of the nature/human relationship; how conceptualizations of “the outside” impact ways we continue to shape the planet and be shaped by it intentionally and by default, and how art can play a role towards environmental conservation. These roles can range from increasing the set of skills of environmental professionals to improving performance and communication, ultimately to be able to shape human behavior towards sustainable practices. Environmental issues are becoming increasingly complex and addressing them requires bridging across the sciences, art and the humanities. We will examine how human attitudes, values and behaviors shape the world we live in today, and the directions we have yet to go. This course is intended to open dialogue and personal reflection on the state of the land and what it says about human beings. In it students will be asked to go beyond simply learning about the complex environmental issues we face today, to thinking critically and understanding what can be done to address them. Course goals will be achieved through lectures, guest presentations, readings, documentaries, remote site visits, discussions, hands-on individual and team projects, and student presentations."
EAS 501.123,Conservation and Development Workshop,Winter 2025,1.5,Bilal Butt,"This survey course explores the changing relations and contestations surrounding the theme of conservation and development. Conservation and development are seen as going hand in hand, and other times as serving different goals. This course aims to examine the nuances behind the polarization of how, if, when, and under what considerations conservation and development should be jointly considered in planning for sustainable development. The course begins by exploring some of the epistemological origins of this debate. Next, we will examine some contemporary conservation and development approaches. The remainder of the course will explore some new and contemporary ideas associated with reconciling conservation and development."
EAS 501.123,Environmental Data Justice,Fall 2025,3,Bilal Butt,"This course is about bringing critical and applied approaches at the intersection between environmental justice and critical data studies to evaluate how, where and to what effect the data-fication of the environment meets environmental and social justice efforts.

EAS 501.158,UN Framework Convention on Climate Change,Fall 2025,1,Avik Basu,"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the primary vehicle for international negotiations addressing anthropogenic climate change. Once a year, the parties to the framework attend a meeting known as the Conference of the Parties (COP). The University of Michigan attained observer status in 2009, and students and faculty have attended, every year, as observer delegates. This course, provided in the Fall term, prepares student delegates and others interested in the UNFCCC. Outreach to the University community is required after the conference."
EAS 501.179,Environmental Communication in a Social World,Winter 2026,3,Nathaniel Geiger,"This class explores how to effectively communicate about environmental issues based on the premise that people are fundamentally social beings.  We will consider how principles of social influence, social support, social identity, social norms, collective efficacy, theories of activism and social movements, power and social status, can be leveraged to improve environmental communication. The class will draw from a variety of social scientific disciplines, including but not limited to interpersonal communication, small group communication, and social psychology."
EAS 501.183,Environmental Advocacy,Fall 2025,3,Geoffrey Henderson,"How can environmental groups successfully advocate for the enactment of policies to address problems like climate change and pollution? In this course, we will use historical and recent case studies to examine environmental organizations' strategies such as grassroots organizing, coalition-building, and legislative lobbying. To understand what can make these strategies effective, we will consider the incentives and information available to policymakers, including their relationships with political parties and interest groups. While the course will focus mostly on cases of advocacy in the United States at the state and federal levels, it will also include cases in other countries and at the international level. Students will have the opportunity to develop skills that will prepare them for communication and negotiation with policymakers, stakeholder groups, and the broader public."
EAS 501.227,Economic Approaches to Environment and Development,Winter 2026,3,Nina Brooks,"Reducing global poverty and protecting the environment—including addressing climate change—are among the most urgent challenges facing our world today. These issues are also closely linked. Environmental problems, like climate change and pollution, can slow or reverse progress in health, education, and economic well-being. At the same time, the way countries develop economically can worsen environmental problems or help to solve them. This course explores the relationships between economic development and the environment through real-world examples, drawing on conceptual frameworks from development and environmental economics."
EAS 501.297,Biogeochemical Cycles,Winter 2025,3,Silvia Santa Maria Newell,"This course examines how the components of Earth (biosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere) combine to affect how nutrients cycle through and between these components.  This understanding forms the basis of the field of biogeochemistry.  We also examine related environmental issues such as climate change, aquatic nutrient pollution (eutrophication) and mitigation, and acid rain.  We also examine how the major nutrients move through different ecosystems (lakes, oceans, wetlands, forests, etc.)."

This course will focus on three grand challenges to the possibility of sustainability and development. 1. Climate change, its impacts, and attempts to mitigate emissions and adapt to climate impacts. 2. Unprecedented, rapid biodiversity loss and the erosion of ecosystem services that threaten to take the biological systems of the planet into more homogenized directions. 3. Poverty and inequality - interrelated with each other as also with climate change and biodiversity loss that have locked hundreds of millions of households into untold misery. For each of these multiplex problem fields, the course will review the scale and nature of issues related to the challenge, examine some of the mechanisms that decision makers at different political and institutional levels have used to address them and assess their effectiveness. Coursework will involve class participation, short presentations, work on sustainability and development cases, and quizzes. Learning goals and outcomes -Develop an understanding of the key challenges to sustainability and development. -Learn core strategies through which decision makers have tried to address these challenges -Assess the effectiveness of implemented mechanisms to address climate change, biodiversity loss, and poverty/inequality -Analyze political and institutional dimensions of sustainability challenges -Apply lessons from analysis of solution mechanisms to a challenge you personally consider crucial to address."
EAS 516.001,Field Remote Sensing,Fall 2025,4,Shannon Brines,"The field component of remote sensing is essential to a full competency in remote sensing and its use in GIS and environmental analysis. In this course you will gain experience making connections between what we see on imagery and what is present on the ground. For landcover/land- use mapping, you will learn image supervised classification using NAIP, Landsat, and Sentinel-2. To support biophysical estimations from remote sensing you will learn how forest biomass/carbon is measured in the field and statistically estimated in the lab; you will also become familiar with drone and lidar data for 3D visualization. For field ground-truth collection in support of remote sensing, you will use High Accuracy GNSS devices and ArcGIS Online's Field Maps, and a variety of analog and digital field measurement tools, and learn sampling methods. For the culmination of this course, you will be able to use GIS, remote sensing and field data to investigate a research question related to forest or ecosystem health at SEAS' properties. Course objectives will be addressed through presentations, guided computer image processing labs, field data collection exercises, and student individual and team approaches.

EAS 519.001,Climate Change vs Everything,Fall 2025,2,Allen Burton,"We’re inundated with predictions of ecosystem collapse, biodiversity loss, extreme weather, and societal upheavals due to climate change. The behavior of policymakers and common sense suggests ecological and societal adaptations will occur slowly (or not at all) in the face of slow climate changes.  How can we be most effective at making a difference and adapting to the new normal? Where should we focus our efforts on protecting and restoring aquatic ecosystems? This course tackles tough realities that human-dominated ecosystems are subjected to a plethora of physical, chemical, and biological stressors – which in part are related to 1) land uses, 2) societal and political norms, 3) economic constraints, and 4) the sensitivity and resilience of the regional ecosystems.  These components vary across geographies and vary as system drivers.  It is important to understand the contribution of each of the 4 drivers and how they are intertwined in the face of climate change. Without such an understanding, management efforts to protect and restore aquatic ecosystems likely will fail.  Examples of these system drivers and typical stressors include: Urban and agricultural runoff of excess nutrients, harmful algal blooms, suspended solids, metals, and pesticides; Habitat alteration including high/flashy flows, siltation, elevated temperature, vegetation loss, and sunlight; Elevated levels of nutrients, pathogens, pesticides, petroleum products (PAHs), metals, salts, tire particles, and plastics; Human dominated landscapes - declining habitat and plant and animal biodiversity along with increasing pathogens (fungal, bacterial, viral), parasites and invasive/introduced species.  Essentially all of these stressors are accentuated by global change, ecosystem warming, and global connectivity. These many stressors intertwine with climate change drivers (flooding, drought, wildfires, higher temperatures) and vary in their extent and magnitude depending on their geographic setting (ecoregion), socio-economic conditions, education, and cultural/historical traditions. In general, increased poverty shifts the importance of managing stressors to basic remedies dealing with sewage, erosion, habitat destruction, flashy and intense runoff and plastic litter.  These situations are often wrapped in environmental justice issues, particularly in urban environments and those near rivers and coastal areas subject to flooding.  The poorest societies will be most affected, becoming climate change migrants.  While it is critical to understand the scientific issues relating stressors to ecosystem health – it is equally important to understand how society and economics drive the prevalence of these stressors and their interactions with climate change. The interactions of physical, chemical and biological stressors must be understood in order to design effective and efficient adaptation management strategies.  These strategies must be region-specific, as “one size does not fit all”."
EAS 520.001,Fluvial Ecosystems,Fall 2025,3,"Allen Burton Duruturk, Berk","Fluvial processes are associated with rivers and streams, and the deposits and landforms created by them. These processes include erosion, corrosion, saltation, deposition, and suspension. Stream erosion may be the most important geomporphic agent. Fluvial processes sculpt the landscape, eroding landforms, transporting sediment and depositing it to create new landforms. Human civilization and ecosystems are both dependent on fluvial systems. This course will provide an overview of fluvial processes and landforms, interacting physical, chemical and biological components, and the consequences of human-societal activities. By understanding patterns and processes of highly diverse fluvial ecosystems, students should be able to better protect and enhance river and stream quality, ecosystem services, functioning and sustainability."
EAS 523.001,Ecol Risk Assessment,Fall 2025,2,Allen Burton,"This course introduces ecological risk assessment (ERA), describing the basics of how ERAs are most often conducted by governments and environmental consultants. In the U.S. the process often follows that of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but Canada and Europe use somewhat different approaches. A wide range of assessments exist dealing with chemical-specific criteria development to the remediation of small to mega-sites exceeding $1billion in costs. Common shortfalls often made when conducting ERAs, such as failing to adequately link stressor exposures to biological effects will be discussed. Case study examples will demonstrate the state-of-the-practice and new approaches that decrease uncertainty associated with the ERA process. The important linkage of ERA issues to decision-making in the risk management process will be emphasized, with real-world, high visibility case studies discussed by national experts.In addition, this year we will utilize a new component to the class – premiering the Michigan Sustainability Class project, in partnership with the U-M School of Public Health. Our case example will focus on the Gelman industry contamination of the Ann Arbor aquifer. Students will ""enter"" the immersive case environment as an assignment (readings, watching videos, listening to interviews) for a couple of days. The in-class case discussion offers a chance to digest and debate elements of the case, after which there will be an engaged learning exercise. We will consider the environmental, human health, and political complexities within which specific quantitative, spatial or other skills are nested in many sustainability situations.

EAS 526.001,Erb Inst Seminar,Fall 2025,1.5,,"This course is designed and delivered by the Erb Institute and tailored specifically for incoming Erb students - including both first-year students, as well as second-year Ross and SEAS students who joined Erb as midyear admits. This is a survey course, which presents a high-level introduction to a wide range of sustainability issues rather than a theoretical analysis or deep-dive into any one particular issue area. A combination of Erb speakers, university faculty and invited sustainability practitioners will lead the sessions. The discussions are designed to be interactive and engaging - which means that the full learning experience will depend on both speaker and student involvement. The Erb Institute's perspective on ""robust sustainability"" covers a broad range of economic, social, environmental, labor, and human-rights risks and opportunities for business. Our stakeholder-based view of the firm (contrasted with the traditional shareholder-based view) recognizes the role of both internal and external stakeholders in helping companies to better understand sustainability issues, minimize risks and leverage business opportunities. The course is intended to meet the following objectives: - Sustainability Exposure: Expose students to a broad understanding of the complex sustainability risks, challenges and opportunities. - Practitioner Perspective: Temper the business perspective with real-life experiences and learnings of seasoned sustainability professionals who have experienced what works and what doesn't in their own careers. - Erb Community: Build community within the new cohort of Erb students."

EAS 528.001,Sustainable Food Sys,Fall 2025,3,"Jennifer Blesh Hoey, Lesli, Jones, Andrew","Today we have entered a new geological epoch – the Anthropocene – characterized by unprecedented human alteration of global processes. This fast-paced global change both affects and is affected by agriculture. Concurrent food, energy, water, and climate crises, and a global rise in obesity amidst widespread hunger and undernutrition, have re-focused public attention on the deficiencies and complexities of the global food system. The dominant industrial food system has increasingly well-documented social, ecological, and health-related costs. Yet, a diversity of ‘alternative’ food systems demonstrates that agriculture can be resource conserving, equitable, and health promoting.   Increasing food system sustainability requires interdisciplinarity along multiple dimensions: reconnecting agriculture with ecological systems, reshaping food production systems to be more nutrition-sensitive, and ensuring that policies and institutions that impact the food system safeguard social equity and the environment. Linking theory and practice is also essential, involving the diverse range of actors moving food from farm to fork. As a result, demand is growing for interdisciplinary scholars and other professionals who are equipped to analyze and address the complex challenges of sustainable food production and global food and nutrition security.   This course will offer a unique opportunity for students to gain interdisciplinary knowledge of food systems and to integrate theory and practice through experiential learning and dialogue-based inquiry both on campus and in the community. Interdisciplinary research and education require bridging worldviews and recognizing the values implicit in different disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. This course will incorporate multiple perspectives, from local to global levels, as well as an understanding of how those perspectives are underpinned by different epistemologies and value systems. That is, this course directly engages with values, exploring how they shape food systems. Benefitting from collaborative interdisciplinary instruction that draws on the expertise of three professors from three different departments, students will develop competencies and cognitive skills in the area of food system sustainability including critical and systems thinking, creativity, and analytical ability."
EAS 529.001,Indig Sus & Env Just,Fall 2025,3,,"Indigenous peoples are among the major architects of environmental movements focusing on sustainability and environmental justice. But whereas many environmentalists focus on restoring or conserving historic ecosystems, Indigenous peoples inhabit landscapes largely altered by different formations of colonialism and racial capitalism. For Indigenous peoples, environmental justice, climate change resilience, food sovereignty, and ecological restoration take on different meanings than typically have been priorities in other environmental movements and sciences. This course seeks to understand, from Indigenous perspectives, how many Indigenous movements, Indigenous sciences and knowledge systems, and the projects of Indigenous organizations and governments seek to achieve sustainability and environmental justice, including the challenges they face and the lessons they have learned. The course cover topics within domains of Indigenous sciences and knowledge systems, Indigenous environmental activism and anti-colonial philosophies, Indigenous research approaches, Indigenous ecologies, Indigenous resilience, and Indigenous legal orders and strategies in law and policy."

EAS 537.001,Urb Sustainability,Fall 2024,3,Brandon Marc Finn,"As engines of capital accumulation, cities have often been viewed as environmental sacrifice zones. Some critics have argued that ‘sustainable cities’ is an oxymoron. Nonetheless, the debate over sustainable development generally, and sustainable urbanism specifically, has succeeded in reshaping and broadening discourse around cities and  attendant policies and outcomes–both in industrialized and industrializing countries. Implying that sustainable use of natural resources involves social justice and economic development as well as environmental concerns, the notion of sustainability has led away from narrower conceptions of urban environmentalism, toward more consideration for the future, greater integration of social and economic goals with environmental and ecological objectives, and hence a fundamental rethinking of how cities should be theorized, planned and managed. This course introduces students to the emerging field of urban sustainability from multiple disciplinary perspectives, primarily industrial ecology, urban political ecology, and urban planning. The course provides students with the theoretical and methodological tools in which to explore the potential for a sustainable urbanism. Approaches to foster more sustainable and resilient forms of urbanization and urban life, from localizations to dematerialization, are introduced and evaluated. Course deliverables include a mid-term exam, a group case-project, and three writing responses. A field trip to Detroit and meetings with stakeholders also form course components."

EAS 539.001,Landscape Ecology,Winter 2025,2,Bill Currie,"*This course will be offered every other Winter term.  Odd years.* Landscape ecology is a question-driven discipline in which the central question is ‘how does landscape structure affect ecological processes?’ This includes ecological processes at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. At the population level, we might ask whether landscape structure affects reproduction or dispersal. At the community level we might ask whether landscape structure affects predator-prey interactions or the success of invasive species. At the ecosystem level we might ask whether landscape structure affects NPP (net primary productivity), evapotranspiration, or carbon sequestration. This course takes an approach that is inquiry-based, evidence- and applied research-oriented, as opposed to theory-driven. We consider the questions that landscape ecology addresses and we analyze studies in the primary literature that have addressed these questions. We examine papers that focus on a variety of ecological systems and habitats including wetlands, grasslands, forests, and human-Images, clockwise from top left: Wetland plant functional types around Poyang Lake, China, Dronova et al. 2012; Mixed use U.S. landscape, Cadenasso et al. 2003; Yellowstone fire of 1988, AnneMullen.com; Google Earth image of a rural village in the Himalaya dominated, multiple-use landscapes. Assigned readings emphasize current literature while lectures and class discussion will cover topics from some additional foundational papers and texts. Although theory is not the focus of the course, we will introduce and discuss some theoretical concepts as needed in order to convey the fundamental principles in the field.   This course has these main areas of focus: 1. Does landscape structure, including variability in both space and time, affect ecological processes? We consider ecological processes at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. 2. What are the characteristics of landscape structure that are used to address question #1? These include patch sizes and distances, the nature of edge-influenced area and patch-interior area, the nature of the landscape matrix as it affects different species, and other topics. 3. What are the causes of landscape structure and heterogeneity, both natural and human-caused? Natural causes include physiographic variability and disturbance regimes. Human causes include resource extraction, land use / land cover change, habitat fragmentation, and others."

The course will provide you with analytical tools and methods for implementing principles of industrial ecology and the circular economy. The practical applications covered in the course will be based largely on current research in the area of life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle design. Life cycle assessment is a comprehensive tool for identifying and evaluating the full environmental burdens associated with a product system from production through retirement. This methodology is used for comparative analyses of alternatives including materials (e.g., biobased vs petroleum based), energy systems (renewable and fossil fuels), consumer products and packaging, automotive component designs, and residential construction methods. Other analytical tools covered include ecological footprint analysis, carbon footprint analysis (life cycle assessment of greenhouse gases), and life cycle cost analysis. Life cycle design focuses on integrating environmental considerations into product design. The challenge is to align and meet performance, cost, legal, and cultural requirements while achieving environmental improvements."

EAS 559.001,Interview Methods & Qualitative Data Analysis,Winter 2026,3,"Alexandra Paige Fischer Zhang, Jenny","Individual and focus group interviews are critical methods for research and practice in environmental and sustainability fields. Interviews reveal detailed information about how and why people think and behave in the ways that they do, and the broader context in which people make decisions. This information can help decision-makers develop policies and programs to harness people's motivations to engage in environmentally sustainable behavior, and help them overcome constraints. This course will train students in individual and focus group interviewing as research strategies and practical tools for gathering information. It will also introduce students to methods for analyzing qualitative data to ensure rigor, usefulness, and communicability of results. The course will consist of lectures, role-plays, and peer feedback on interview project components, including research designs, interview guides, codebooks, analytical memos, and network and matrix displays of key findings."

Instead, the focus must be on making a transition to a low-material-throughput pattern of living at individual, collective, and institutional levels (Mazur 2024). However, intentionally, and against the dominant social norm, this course frames this new reality as an opportunity to emphasize behaviors that increase well-being (De Young 2019). It foresees a shift toward tangible, small-scale initiatives aimed at building neighborhood resilience, with communities following Brooks’ (2019) advice to emphasize “…individualism less and relationalism more,” resulting in an unexpected increase in well-being."

Although it is an ecological necessity to live an austere existence, people will not eagerly pursue such a life if it is only presented as a necessity of survival. The issue here is psychological. How do we reframe and promote a sustainable existence so that people not only accept it, but actually seek it out? How do we support people so they begin building this society as soon as possible? These questions are explored through the framework of their being a behavioral challenge, not a political or technological issue. To meet this challenge, behavior change strategies are reviewed, some in early stages of development. Emphasis is on changing behavior in ways that it remains changed (durable) long after the intervention program ends, and expands to include new behaviors. Examples of such durable and growing behavior change are provided at the individual, neighborhood, and community level. Behavior change is further studied through the local, recently developed A2Zero carbon neutrality initiative."

Two additional books, one a history, one fictional (or collection of stories) are chosen from a list. Prior to each class session students write and submit a “principle of transition” derived from the week’s assigned readings. It can take the form of a general causal pattern or a “do something,” that is, a practical implication of the readings. The principle should orient to 21st century transformation with rigorous sustainability as the goal. One of the two chosen books is presented in class, one is presented one-on-one to the instructor. A 3-page write-up of each book is submitted at the end of the semester (guidelines provided)."
EAS 567.001,Soc Vulnrblt&Adapt,Fall 2025,3,Alexandra Paige Fischer,"Increasingly frequent and severe wildfires, floods, and storm events raise concerns about how society can adapt to environmental change. The concept of social vulnerability is critical to identifying opportunities for adaptation. Social vulnerability refers to the geographic and socio-economic influences on the chance of harm to humans and the capacity of people to prepare and respond. Adaptations are strategies individuals, societies, or governments undertake in response to or anticipate environmental changes and climate threats. This three-credit course will introduce students to the concepts of social vulnerability and adaptation as well as frameworks for assessing vulnerability and planning adaptation in human communities. The course will explore theories and methods for investigating social vulnerability and adaptation from a behavioral perspective. We will not address these concepts from an environmental policy or politics perspective. Students will learn about methods for evaluating exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity at different levels of social organization (individuals, communities, institutions), as well as approaches to designing vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans. The focus will be on climate change and related natural hazards relevant to coastal and inland areas, including wildfire, drought, flooding, sea level rise, and storm events. Small group discussions, projects, and conversations with practitioners will engage students in co-learning. By bringing different analytical perspectives and real-world case studies on vulnerability and adaptation, this class will help students understand, access, and promote sustainable and positive change in the face of accelerating global environmental changes."

It is a truly global collective action problem, whose damages are massive, widespread, unpredictable, and inequitably distributed. How, and how fast, will we decarbonize the planet? In this course, we will investigate these questions from an economic perspective. Economic analysis of the climate problem is valuable for a number of reasons: economics provides a framework for understanding incentives for human behavior; it facilitates the evaluation of markets and policies; and it is a language to which people listen, from the highest levels of government down to the individual household. In this course, we will use the lens of economics to clarify the challenge of climate change, understand market function in emissions-intensive industries, and evaluate the theoretical and empirical impacts of the climate policies at our disposal. We will start by reviewing some foundational economic concepts, as well as modeling and comparing the impacts of market-based and prescriptive policies. In the second unit of the course, we will zoom in on electricity, a sector with enormous greenhouse gas emissions and enormous importance for widespread decarbonization. In the third unit, we will consider several other applications of climate economics: energy efficiency, transportation, food and agriculture, water, nature-based solutions, and carbon neutrality.

The first half of the course considers resources which are privately owned; the second half considers resources that are common property. To provide a point of reference, the behavior of resource markets in the absence of government intervention is studied first. There is then an extensive treatment of the dynamic effects on market equilibria of widespread government policies (unanticipated, partially anticipated or fully anticipated). Policies analyzed include: bufferstocks used to affect prices (ceilings, floors, bands, and pegs); bans, embargoes, price controls and whatever else is timely or of interest to participants. To simplify the mathematics, discrete-time methods are used predominately. The Kuhn-Tucker theorem is utilized when studying competitive equilibrium under certainty. Dynamic-programming is used to study single-agent (planning or monopoly) problems under uncertainty (with or without learning). Multi-stage game theory is used to investigate dynamic common-property problems. A working understanding of these methods is developed during the course."

EAS 677.060,Introduction to Conservation and Real Estate: Cases of Indigenous Peoples' Land Return,Winter 2026,1.5,,"One of the most important pathways for expanding conservation, whether for biodiversity, agroecology or climate response, is expanding landbases in which environmental protection can be prioritized. Historically, large conservation organizations have leveraged real estate expertise and legal advocacy to protect large territories. Today, there is a movement afoot whereby smaller communities with deep environmental ethics are leading efforts to use real estate expertise to expand their conservation efforts, whether in rural or urban areas. Yet the reality is that these efforts are not just about real estate, but about expertise in economic and social planning, negotiation, consultation, networking, cultural revitalization, community participation, leadership, ingenuity, and legal and policy strategy. The course introduces students to some of the basics of how such expertise can be harnessed to grow conservation areas, with an emphasis on how Indigenous peoples have done so in ways that combine rights, culture, and environmental protection. While the cases will be relating to Indigenous peoples, the course will be beneficial to anyone seeking to gain introductory knowledge in this important area."

Topics will include corporate power, theories of supply chain coordination and governance (e.g., global value chains), opacity and the first mile, the evolving regulatory space, data and methods for supply chain transparency, green capital accumulation and power asymmetries in supply chains, and the implications sustainability initiatives for producers at the base of supply chains."
EAS 677.080,Social Nature of Pro-Environmental Action,Winter 2025,1.5,Nathaniel Geiger,"This seminar explores readings and theories that considers how pro-environmental action is an explicitly social phenomenon.  We will consider the roles of social influence, social support, social identity, social norms, collective efficacy, self-presentation concerns, theories of activism and social movements, power and social status, and other social literatures to explore how pro-environmental action is promoted or discouraged at various levels, including consumers, citizens, and institutions."
EAS 677.083,Environmental Policy Implications of the 2024 Election,Winter 2025,1.5,Geoffrey Henderson,"Regardless of the outcome, the 2024 election will bring significant consequences for environmental policy. Will the United States be able to take further action to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions? Will the administrative state reprise its role in environmental protection, or will the government's ability to protect the environment continue to erode? Throughout the term, we will analyze reporting on current events to understand how the results of recent elections have shaped the prospects for environmental policymaking in the coming years. To better understand current events, we will discuss academic books and articles examining questions relevant to environmental policymaking, such as whether reforms can be enacted under divided government. Students will learn how electoral politics affects the actors, interests, and institutions that shape environmental policy, and how to communicate effectively about strategies for enacting and implementing environmental policy under political constraints."
EAS 677.085,Engagement for Impact,Winter 2024,2,Lisa DuRussel,"EAS677.085 is focused on building and executing foundational skills for impactful community engagement through service learning.

You will have the opportunity to put skills learned into real-world practice as we partner with engagement experts and a Detroit based community partner to pitch, prototype, and pilot an engaged activity to share at a community Earth Fest event in Detroit. This activity will be crafted around a “sustainability topic” that you will identify and use as a frame throughout the course - first individually, then in a team - to practice and apply the the mindsets and methods learned in class. Each class discussion, paired with guest lectures and in class activities will help you explore your chosen topic from a new angle, and position you for the final term project. Students will leave the course with boots on the ground experience and an actionable toolkit to strengthen engagement and organizing practices outside the classroom and into the real world."
EAS 677.086,Water Resource Economics,Fall 2024,1,Michael R. Moore,"The legal and policy institutions of water resources, along with their physical features, give rise to the field of water resource economics. The market is a core analytical concept of microeconomics. Yet rarely, if ever, do we observe markets at work in allocating water resources and water quality. Instead, the various settings of water allocation are often particular and idiosyncratic; this makes water resource economics challenging, and interesting, to study. While we do not observe many markets, we continue to apply concepts of demand and supply, and the several forms of externalities, to water and water resources. Most of our subject matter will involve the United States ? The physical, legal, and public policy features of freshwater resources in the United States. Learning goals: to apply the principles and methods of microeconomics and environmental economics to contemporary water-resource issues; and to develop an understanding of the physical, legal, and public-policy features of freshwater resources in the United States. Knowledge competencies: microeconomic principles of water allocation institutions; application of environmental economics to water resources; and legal and public-policy institutions of U.S. water resources. Skill competencies: quantitative reasoning and skills, and water-policy analysis."

This studio aims to further develop skills in conceptualization and visualization through consideration of contemporary urban design issues. It includes documentation and analysis of urban form and process, and explores site planning and design of the public realm. Issues of local and regional identity and sustainability inform the approach of the studio.   Objectives 1. To gain experience in documenting, analyzing and understanding urban form and its evolution 2. To develop knowledge of key concepts and principles of urban design and their application through the exploration of an approach and methodology for urban design 3. To develop the ability to address issues and opportunities at the urban scale in three-dimensional form through a process of design development 4. To gain experience in graphic thinking and communication as it relates to urban design   The course aims for students to engage with complex urban design challenges and to achieve levels of design resolution well beyond their previous studio assignments, while critically engaging and challenging their own design processes. Students are required to take a clear position on the issues at stake and articulate that position visually and spatially through their own individual project. All assignment work will be project-based, with each of the stages building upon one another to produce a final design that demonstrates technical, theoretical, ecological and spatial competencies."

This urban place dynamic includes ecological, atmospheric, hydrological and geological factors; global trade and financial markets; water, waste, energy, communication, and transportation infrastructure maintenance and construction; fate and transport of pollutants and contaminants; economic use, design, development, occupancy and management, and abandonment of landscapes by different communities and for different purposes; and different aesthetic, spiritual, and cultural interpretations and interventions by people who “own” the place in different ways.  Among these drivers is design – not only as an intervention in this dynamic - but also as an imaginative proposal that inherently opens possibilities for future landscapes."
EAS 787.002,Metro Dynamic Studio,Fall 2024,2,"Lisa DuRussel Zuo, Chen","This course focuses on broad issues of a developing metropolitan region. The format provides the opportunity to investigate comprehensive, individual and team-based design solutions starting at the regional scale, down to masterplanning scale, and finally at the site scale where you will identify a catalyst project to further explore in Winter term. This course explicitly challenges students to creatively shift across scales, across ecological and anthropomorphic systems, and among cultural and ecological variables. It synthesizes the skills and knowledge offered at SEAS to allow students to have a comprehensive design + design thinking experience. The course helps students expand their own process, while refining all levels of communication skills, including visualization, oral presentations, modeling, mapping, and written narrative. The theme of this year’s studio is THE HOW AND NOW OF ENVISIONING RESILIENCY. Our work will support the Envision Resilience Challenge, a partnership of Universities and individuals affiliated with the nonprofit Remain. FALL B will focus primarily on advancing your design work, identifying and leaning in to the message you are trying to convey and then pitching it to a larger audience."

This urban place dynamic includes ecological, atmospheric, hydrological and geological factors; global trade and financial markets; water, waste, energy, communication, and transportation infrastructure maintenance and construction; fate and transport of pollutants and contaminants; economic use, design, development, occupancy and management, and abandonment of landscapes by different communities and for different purposes; and different aesthetic, spiritual, and cultural interpretations and interventions by people who “own” the place in different ways.  Among these drivers is design – not only as an intervention in this dynamic - but also as an imaginative proposal that inherently opens possibilities for future landscapes."
