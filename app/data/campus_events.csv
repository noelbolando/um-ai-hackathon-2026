Making Armenian Americans invites viewers into a moment of possibility in the early 20th century, when Armenians fleeing violence at the end of the Ottoman Empire came to reinvent themselves in the promise of America. Drawn from the archives of Project Save, these photographs capture different valences of American life, as experienced, performed, and imagined by Armenian immigrants. From naturalization classes to festivals of nations, from breaking new ground for churches to mundane tableaus of Thanksgiving and Christmas, this range of photographs offers a glimpse of a community in the making, one that sought to preserve a memory of its Ottoman past even while anticipating an American future.",https://events.umich.edu/event/143388,,,,,"Area Studies

*Back in Bahia: The Repatriation Journey of Afro-Brazilian Art from Detroit to Salvador* traces one of the largest repatriation efforts of Afro-Brazilian art to date. Led by the Detroit-based nonprofit Con/Vida: Popular Arts of the Americas, the initiative is returning more than 750 works of Afro-Brazilian popular art to Salvador, Bahia, where they will enter the collection of the National Museum of Afro-Brazilian Culture (MUNCAB). Built over three decades through sustained relationships with artists, families, and workshops across Northeastern Brazil, the collection reflects the creative ingenuity, community memory, and diasporic traditions that define Afro-Brazilian popular art.

This exhibition highlights selected works from the broader repatriation effort, recognizing the artists and cultural stewards in Brazil and Michigan who made this historic return possible. Featured are woodcut prints by João Francisco Borges, Nilo dos Santos, Givanildo Francisco da Silva, and José Miguel da Silva, alongside examples of *literatura de cordel*—popular printed booklets that combine social commentary, folklore, poetry, and song.

Jack pine barrens are imperiled, fire-dependent ecosystems that occur in central and northern Michigan and host numerous rare plant and animal species, including the Kirtland’s warbler.

To bring together the complex community of researchers, forest managers and conservationists focused on jack pine ecosystems, the University of Michigan Biological Station and Northern Pine Plains Partnership will co-host the inaugural Jack Pine Research Symposium.

The free, two-day event is Thursday and Friday, Feb. 19-20, at the University of Michigan Biological Station, located at 9133 Biological Rd. in Pellston.

Registration is required in advance through an online registration form.

“From ornithology to fire ecology, work related to jack pine forests spans a wide scope,” said Adam Schubel, resident biologist at the U-M Biological Station. “It can be tough for active practitioners from different specializations to connect on parallel efforts or emerging innovations happening just over the horizon. This symposium is an opportunity to bring everyone together in an inspiring setting to share knowledge, identify cooperative approaches, build community and chart the future of jack pine research and management in Michigan.”

The symposium will feature speakers and presentations on Thursday, Feb. 19. Discussion and networking will be the focus on Friday, Feb. 20.

Lodging is available at UMBS for a fee of $75 a night, upon request.

Contact Adam Schubel at aschubel@umich.edu with questions about the symposium or to make a housing request.

Contemporary jack pine habitat management is the result of decades of research-driven adaptive management and collaboration.

This effort resulted in successfully emulating many features of a complex ecosystem reconstructed through alternative processes, the recovery of the Kirtland’s Warbler from the brink of extinction, and advanced prescribed fire science.

New ecological questions and management challenges are emerging, in addition to those that have existed for decades.

The Jack Pine Research Symposium aims to discover new collaborative pathways forward and foster new connections.

 

The University of Michigan Biological Station serves as a gathering place to learn from the natural world, advance research and education, and inspire action. We leverage over a century of research and transformative experiences to drive discoveries and solutions to benefit Michigan and beyond.

Our vast campus engages all of the senses. Its remote, natural setting nurtures deep thought and scientific discovery.

Founded in 1909, UMBS supports long-term research and education through immersive, field-based courses and features state-of-the-art equipment and facilities for data collection and analysis to help any field researcher be productive.

Galbreath’s work has been showcased locally, nationally and internationally in over 20 solo/two person and over 100 group exhibitions.

Galbreath has an M.F.A. from the James Pearson Duffy Department of Art, Art History, & Design, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI; and a B.F.A. with Permanent K-12 Certification from The Gwen Frostic School of Art, Western MI University, Kalamazoo, MI. Galbreath has chaperoned eleven intensive, immersive art experiences to Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, England, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and the Czech Republic. Lynn is a retired Adjunct Associate Professor of Studio Art from Oakland University, where she has been on the faculty of the Department of Art & Art History since 2000. Lynn has also instructed studio art and design at the College For Creative Studies, University of Detroit Mercy — School of Architecture, Macomb Community College, Wayne State University, and Bloomfield University School. Her work can be seen in the collections of Oakland University, Wayne State University, Detroit Receiving Hospital, Children’s Hospital of Michigan, Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital and numerous private collections.

This exhibition consists of works from a variety of series created by Galbreath over the years: Telegraph, Storyboard, and Working Hard for a Living. Each series represents a unique exploration of themes, techniques, and social commentaries that reflect Galbreath’s artistic journey and concerns for the world.

Telegraph explores the aesthetic visual weights and balances between harmony and content, diving deep into how visual elements can convey messages and emotions. This series invites viewers to reflect on the way art communicates through its formal qualities, as well as its narrative possibilities. The careful interplay of shapes, colors, and textures in these works prompts an examination of the viewer's perception and emotional response. By utilizing abstract forms, Galbreath encourages an engagement that goes beyond mere observation, seeking to provoke thought about how aesthetic choices influence understanding and meaning.

On the other hand, Storyboard is a series of image-driven installation paintings that vary greatly in size, showcasing Galbreath’s versatility and creative ingenuity. The titles of the works draw inspiration from the years spent creating visuals for TV commercials and public service announcements, illustrating how commercial art often intertwines with societal messages. This series emphasizes the profound impact visual narratives have on consumer culture and public perception, underscoring the artist's belief in the potency of imagery to shape narratives. The installations weave a complex fabric of storytelling that challenges viewers to reconsider their relationship with media and the messages they consume daily.

Working Hard for a Living pays tribute to our sustainable and unsustainable resources, shedding light on the individuals who toil diligently within these economic frameworks. This series highlights the hard-working suppliers of essential products, including Farm Market Managers, Fishmongers, and Beach Vendors. By portraying these self-employed individuals, often operating within informal economies, Galbreath draws attention to the unique challenges they face. These individuals frequently contend with low, inconsistent incomes, long hours, and sometimes exploitative conditions, fostering a sense of solidarity with those who labor under such circumstances.

Furthermore, the series invites viewers to confront the broader societal structures that contribute to these inequities. Galbreath's work serves not only as a tribute but also as a call to action to consider how our consumer habits and economic policies affect the livelihoods of others. The layered narratives present in this series open a dialogue about the value we place on labor and the often unseen struggles that support our day-to-day lives. Through these explorations, Galbreath establishes a multifaceted narrative that intertwines art with activism, compelling audiences to engage both aesthetically and ethically with the realities depicted in the exhibition.",https://events.umich.edu/event/142773,North Campus Research Complex Building 18,Rotunda Gallery,North Campus Research Complex Building 18,,"Art

While the objects on display are disparate at first glance, ranging from lead tablets and amulets to papyrus and parchment leaves, they all share a common thread: they have long been labeled as ""magical"" in traditional Western scholarship.

However, each of these artifacts is better understood on a broad spectrum of ancient ritual, from subversive and transgressive acts to highly social and visible ones. The exhibit highlights the objects’ oft-overlooked material dimensions, asking us to consider how qualities like color, texture, and weight shaped an object’s perceived efficacy and meaning. 

This exhibit was a collaboration, and displays items from several University of Michigan units: the library’s Special Collections Research Center and Papyrology Collection, the Museum of Natural History, and the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology. It was curated by Abigail Staub, PhD Candidate, Interdepartmental Program in Mediterranean Art & Archaeology.

These paintings serve as a visual record of Detroit’s transformation, capturing humanity’s impact on the environment alongside nature’s persistent efforts to reclaim these spaces. As the city continues to change, many of these depicted scenes are vanishing, no longer visible in the landscape today. The significance of this documentation goes beyond mere nostalgia; it invites viewers to reflect on the dynamic interplay between urban development and ecological restoration, prompting a deeper understanding of how cities evolve while retaining traces of their history.

Swafford’s paintings are created on location and in one session. The natural conditions, including light, shadow, and atmosphere, change dramatically from hour to hour and day to day, forcing the artist to respond quickly and decisively. This approach, born of a direct engagement with the subject and the fleeting nature of the scene, along with his wet-on-wet technique, keeps the work fresh and immediate. By immersing himself in the environment, Swafford captures the diverse textures and vibrant colors that characterize Detroit’s landscape, imbuing his work with a sense of urgency and spontaneity. Each brushstroke conveys a commitment not only to visual accuracy but also to emotional resonance, as he strives to encapsulate the spirit of a place that is both loved and contested.

In addition to these works, the artist constantly sketches ideas both for paintings and for designing projects in his business. These sketches serve as visual language, helping him clarify and refine his concepts before bringing them to life. They become a means to communicate ideas to clients and his crew and become an extension of his voice—an academic exercise rooted in artistic practice that fosters collaboration and innovation. The act of sketching also reflects his evolving relationship with the city, as each drawing encapsulates fleeting moments of inspiration drawn directly from his surroundings. This duality of function—creating art for exhibition and conceptualizing designs for projects—demonstrates Swafford’s versatility and adaptability as an artist.

Swafford received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in painting from the Rhode Island School of Design, and while at RISD, he was part of the European Honors Program. His education not only honed his technical skills but also broadened his artistic perspective through exposure to varied artistic traditions. He has shown his work in both solo and group exhibitions in Chicago, Kansas City, and New York State. Each exhibition serves as a testament to his commitment to his craft and his ability to engage diverse audiences, offering them an opportunity to explore the complex narratives woven into each landscape.",https://events.umich.edu/event/142768,North Campus Research Complex Building 18,Connections Gallery,North Campus Research Complex Building 18,,"Art

142791-21891575,2/20/26 9:00,2/20/26 17:00,Tukilile Vaa,An exhibition by Kaloki Nyamai,Exhibition,"Kaloki Nyamai is a multidisciplinary artist based in Nairobi. His practice explores Kenya's histories and collective memory, blending Kamba traditions with contemporary narratives. Using acrylic paint, rope, photo transfers, and stitched yarn, his free-hanging immersive works blur the boundaries between painting, sculpture, and installation. For his U-M project, Nyamai will present one large unstretched piece and two framed paintings at the Institute for the Humanities, as well as a second free-hanging work at the U-M Museum of Art.

The physicality of his complex constructions inspire wonder in the viewer. The works are vast in scale, embedded with stories, where past and future merge both poetically and conceptually. In each composition, the artist proposes a powerful alternative to the flatness of singular narratives of Kenyan history and identity presented as the definitive postcolonial account. He likens the formal act of stitching to symbolically unifying a wounded or fractured community.

Nyamai founded the Kamene Cultural & Research Center in Nairobi, a creative and collaborative hub dedicated to the preservation, promotion, and innovation of African cultural practices.

About the artist:
Kaloki Nyamai (*1985 in Kitui, Kenya) is a multidisciplinary artist working with installation, painting, and sculpture based in Nairobi. From an early age, his mother introduced him to painting and taught him to draw, fostering an ever-lasting interest in art throughout his life. He often finds inspiration in his grandmother’s stories of the Kamba people, a Bantu ethnic group of eastern Kenya. Using materials like acrylic paint, sisal rope, photo transfers, and stitched yarn, Nyamai’s free-hanging pieces evoke the healing of historical wounds and a collective yearning for renewal. His works blur the boundaries between painting, sculpture, and installation, creating cohesive, immersive experiences where past, present, and future converge poetically.

Nyamai studied Interior Design at the Buruburu Institute Of Fine Arts (BIFA) and then pursued painting after working in other creative fields. His large-scale paintings and mixed-media installations intricately explore historical narratives, examining their resonance in the present. Nyamai has shown his work across the globe in solo exhibitions at the Norval Foundation, Cape Town (2024); James Cohan Gallery, New York (2024); Galerie Barbara Thumm, Berlin (2023 and 2022); SEPTIEME Gallery, Paris (2019), and other venues. In 2023, he featured part of his series Dining in Chaos in the “Unlimited” section at Art Basel in Basel. He has participated in group exhibitions and biennials, most recently at the Sharjah Biennial 16, Sharjah (2025); The Völklinger Hütte, Völklingen (2024); the Kenyan Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, Venice (2022); and the Dakar Biennale (2022). His works are part of numerous private and institutional collections around the world, such as the Dallas Art Museum, the Southern African Foundation for Contemporary Art, and the Arthur Primas Museum.",https://events.umich.edu/event/142791,202 S.

Jones, ""The Trouble of Color: An American Family Memoir”",,Lecture / Discussion,"Prizewinning scholar and renowned author of Black history Martha S. Jones will join the Bookworm for a conversation on identity, belonging, and family, drawing from her powerful new book, The Trouble with Color: An American Family Memoir.

Martha S. Jones grew up feeling her Black identity was obvious to all who saw her. But weeks into college, a Black Studies classmate challenged Jones’s right to speak. Suspicious of the color of her skin and the texture of her hair, he confronted her with a question that inspired a lifetime of introspection: “Who do you think you are?”

Jones delves into her family’s past for answers. In every generation since her great-great-great-grandmother survived enslavement to raise a free family, color determined her ancestors’ lives. But the color line was shifting and jagged, not fixed and straight. Some backed away from it, others skipped along it, and others still were cut deep by its sharp teeth.

Journeying across centuries, from rural Kentucky and small-town North Carolina to New York City and its suburbs, The Trouble of Color is a lyrical, deeply felt meditation on the most fundamental matters of identity, belonging, and family.

In these settings, panels of judges score candidates across sequential stages, and these scores are aggregated into a consensus ranking. Standard practice typically employs arithmetic averaging, often supplemented with ad-hoc ""corrections"" for outliers or scale differences. However, such approaches suffer from three core statistical problems: (1) Scale Heterogeneity, where judges exhibit varying levels of discrimination and range-restriction; (2) Information Loss, where the longitudinal ""trajectory"" of a candidate is sidestepped in favor of stage-specific snapshots; and (3) Nonignorable Missingness, where conflict-of-interest (COI) recusals can introduce systematic bias.

We develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework that addresses these issues simultaneously. First, we treat observed scores as generators of ordinal tie-blocks, bypassing the ""cardinality fallacy"" and modeling the probability of observed ranks. Second, we link sequential rounds via a fusion model with LKJ correlation priors, allowing the model to borrow strength across the tournament while regularizing the latent covariance. Third, we introduce a novel Informative Missing Data Likelihood (MDL) that treats COI recusals as a form of informative censoring. When judges abstain from rating their own students or collaborators, standard approaches invoke a ""Missing Completely at Random"" (MCAR) assumption. Our MDL instead retains recused candidates in the ""risk set"" as censored alternatives, correcting for the potential bias in win probabilities that occurs when high-caliber competitors are systematically excluded from a judge’s denominator. The model combines a Plackett–Luce formulation for tied data (implemented via Elementary Symmetric Polynomials) with judge-specific discrimination parameters that automatically downweight poorly-calibrated raters, and the full posterior can be efficiently sampled via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, allowing full uncertainty quantification in downstream estimands.

We apply this framework to a high-stakes international competition — to be revealed during the talk! — featuring dozens of candidates, multiple rounds, and nearly 20 elite judges. Analysis suggests that the standard scoring method and the MDL-augmented model produce distinctly different results: they disagree on the winner and posterior advancement probabilities, driven almost entirely by the differential treatment of collaborator-based recusals. Sensitivity analysis reveals that these outcomes are largely contingent on the assumed missing data mechanism. By making these untestable assumptions explicit, we provide a more transparent and principled foundation for high-stakes adjudication in grant panels, hiring committees, and both athletic and artistic judging.",https://events.umich.edu/event/144784,West Hall,340,West Hall,,seminar,"Department of Statistics

138032-21881297,2/20/26 11:00,2/20/26 19:00,Fore-Site (Phase 2): The Stamps Gallery Pillar Project,,Exhibition,"

From September 2025 through August 2026, Stamps Gallery is partnering in a curatorial collaboration with two Ypsilanti-based, artist-run project spaces led by Stamps alumni: C.Y.N.K. Studios, directed by Sally Clegg (Lecturer III and Student Exhibition Coordinator, MFA ’20) and Abhishek Narula (MFA ’20); and Sometimes Space, directed by Nathan Byrne (Lecturer I, MFA ’21). Each space hosts dozens of artists annually for exhibitions, performances, and events, fostering experimental work and building community. For this project, Byrne, Clegg, and Narula have been commissioned to reimagine the pillars on Division Street that flank the gallery. In response, they’ve curated six artists to create new work for the pillars over three cycles:

Phase 1 (September 12 - December 12) artists: Amelia Burns (Cranbrook MFA ’23) and Erin McKenna (MFA ’20)
Phase 2 (January 12 - April 12) artists: Sally Clegg (MFA ’20) and Kim Karlsrud (MFA ’20)
Phase 3 (May 12 - August 12) artists: Abhishek Narula (MFA ’20) and Nathan Byrne (MFA ’21)
Phase 2 Curatorial Statement

Curated by Sometimes Space: Sally Clegg (entry pillar)
Curated by CYNK Studios: Kim Karlsrud (courtyard pillar)

Artists Sally Clegg and Kim Karlsrud wrap the Division Street pillars in highly site-specific ornament unearthed from the overlooked margins of Ann Arbor. On the Courtyard pillar, Karlsrud scales up photographs of objects found in liminal spaces surrounding campus buildings on Green Road, which the artist has encrusted in road salt. On the entryway pillar, Clegg zooms in on tiny fragments of found material from UMich’s famous “rock” to celebrate nearly seven decades of student art and activism. Both artists uplift aggregate of local human activity to reveal tiny worlds of found form. 

Sally Clegg: Sentimentary Rock
Sentimentary Rock is a composition of paint slag collected from the UMich rock monument at the corner of Washtenaw Avenue and Hill Street. This colorful composite material has been accumulating at the base of the iconic limestone boulder since the mid 1950’s, when students began a tradition of painting it in acts of protest, creativity, and ritual, sometimes multiple times per week. Akin to byproducts of industry such as “Fordite” (collectable chunks of automotive overspray sometimes called ‘Detroit agate’), Sentimentary Rock includes thousands of layers, each dripped from a palimpsestic public proclamation. When processed, sculpted, sealed, assembled, and macro-photographed, the result is this enlarged array of tiny gems, intended to celebrate the indissoluble student voice. 

Kim Karlsrud: What Amasses
What Amasses is an assemblage of everyday found objects collected within the Miller Creek watershed, an urbanized drainage system that encompasses much of the city of Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan campus. Selected objects were immersed in a road salt solution, allowing delicate crystalline formations to emerge. Road salt is a common material input into these hydrological networks during the winter months and exists in multiple states of refinement, expression, coherence, and fragmentation. Each object was then arranged, photographed, and enlarged to recontextualize these materials in ways that invite deeper reflections on how infrastructure and human agency blur notions of the natural and the artificial. 
Artist Statements/Bios

Sally Clegg 
Sally Clegg is an artist and educator from Pelham, Massachusetts. Her studio practice is rooted in sculpture and expanded printmaking, stemming from a fascination with human efforts to make meaning from our relationships to objects. Clegg integrates history, popular culture, literature and philosophy as material for artmaking, leveraging personal anecdote and humor to reveal the complexity, absurdity, and theoretical richness at play in our connections to things and to ourselves. 

Clegg holds an MFA in Art from The University of Michigan Stamps School of Art & Design, and a BA in Art & English from Goucher College. She has exhibited nationally and internationally, and her work can be found in permanent collections at Yale University, The New York Public Library, and elsewhere. Her artwork and writing has appeared in ASAP/Journal, BOMB Magazine, Sculpture Magazine, and Hyperallergic. She is a lecturer in Art & Design at the University of Michigan. Website / Instagram


Kim Karlsrud 
Kim Karlsrud is the co-founder of Commonstudio, a collaborative creative practice that develops socio-ecological and spatial interventions, installations, and initiatives working with and within urban landscapes. Her work explores the space between art and design, and is grounded in the concept of the “commons,” that which is shared, as well as that which is ordinary, banal, and commonplace.

Karlsrud completed her undergraduate degree in Product Design from Otis College of Art and Design and an MFA in Art from the University of Michigan. She is currently an Assistant Visiting Professor in the College of Design at the University of Oregon, teaching across Art and Landscape Architecture departments. She jointly received the 2014-15 Prince Charitable Trust Rome Prize in Landscape Architecture, was a 2017 resident at the Headlands Center for the Arts, and is the 2025-26 Fuller Fieldscape Fellow.

The socio-economic relationships between a large-scale public monument at Huaca Prieta and outlying domestic sites on the north coast of Peru during the Middle Holocene are examined in terms of community formation and identity-marking. Between ~7000 and 5500 BP population expansion and community integration developed among fishing and farming households residing in different littoral habitats. The development of a cohesive community is viewed in terms of the creation of a communing identity, defined by previously unconnected subgroups of weavers (cotton textiles and fish nets) and seafood specialists and by standardized, inter-household and -subgroup ritual and mortuary acts at Huaca Prieta. This research challenges accepted interpretations such as early communities and public monuments formed by elites controlling food production, exchange networks, and corporate labor.",https://events.umich.edu/event/143143,School of Education,1322,School of Education,,Archaeology,Museum of Anthropological Archaeology

The webinar is free and open to the public, but registration is required. Once you've registered, joining information will be sent to your email. Register for the Zoom webinar at: http://myumi.ch/A1MdA

Thai Buddhism is highly polymorphic, with wide regional and historical variation, with practices ranging from magical power to spirit possession to ethical codes to meditation. People draw from these elements to meet the demands of social, historical, political, and other contexts. In this talk, Stonington asks what assemblages of religious practice might
   emerge in the face of domineering experiences of the body. Severe pain has been described by phenomenologists as a totalizing experience, making it an ideal test case for this inquiry.
   
   Through interviews and participant observation with people coping with severe pain in Northern Thailand, Stonington argues that a specific set of meditation practices that showed up as orthodox for how they should relate to pain actually made their pain worse, sending them on investigative journeys to assemble novel sets of tools from other practices available to them. Through this isolated individual investigation, his interlocutors surprisingly settled on techniques similar to one another, a kind of emergent locally-heterodox rejection of received wisdom.
   
   Scott Stonington is a sociocultural anthropologist and internal medicine physician at the University of Michigan. His first book *The Spirit Ambulance*, about dying in Thailand, won awards for ethnographic writing and social theory. Current major projects include the politics and experience of pain in Thailand; and the harms generated by time pressure, emotion, and improvisation in the clinical encounter in the U.S.

All U-M students, faculty, and staff are welcome to participate in guided meditation practice with a trainer every Friday at noon over Zoom (details to join are provided below). No prior experience with meditation is required. 

*What will you learn?*

The guided meditation practice involves three simple steps: relaxation, rejuvenation, and meditation.

Relaxation brings your body to a calm, steady posture creating a stillness at the physical level, and prepares the mind for meditation. We follow this with a rejuvenation method to detox the mind to let go of stress and complex emotions, and will leave you feeling light and refreshed. Lastly, learning to meditate by being mindful of your heart will connect you with yourself by listening to your heart’s voice. 

*Why Meditate?*

While physical fitness keeps our bodies in shape, meditation is an exercise for the mind and mental wellness. In addition to the measurable benefits mentally and physically, many people benefit from an unquantifiable inner poise and harmony. 

*Please take Learn to Meditate session if you are new to the practice. These sessions are offered Monthly.* https://events.umich.edu/event/128708

At this moment, as a University of Michigan graduate student, you may be in fact, amongst the world’s experts in your field. It took hard work to get there – hours in the classroom, more hours in the lab – physical or virtual. Here you are – at the top of your game. Then you get a job in industry, and your first project – and it has very little to do with your expertise. It can be alarming and disarming. And it can be the start of an incredible ride and fulfilling career. In this edition of the Life After Graduate School seminar series, Joel will review how adaptability and agility have brought him opportunities he never imagined, and satisfaction he celebrates daily.

Bio: Joel McDonald is the Technical Director for Dow’s MobilityScience segment, where he leads Dow’s efforts to deliver innovative solutions to automakers and their suppliers worldwide. He has held a variety of technical and strategy leadership positions at Dow over the 16 years of his career, with a particular emphasis on battery materials, electronics, and coatings. Before Dow, Joel was a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Sandia National Labs in New Mexico, where he explored fundamental reaction kinetics in energetic materials. Joel completed his PhD in Applied Physics at the University of Michigan in 2007 under the advisement of Prof. Steven Yalisove, where his dissertation focused on the interaction between ultrashort pulsed lasers and materials. A native of Michigan, Joel enjoys traveling adventures with his wife and two children, fishing the local rivers and streams with his dad and bud",https://events.umich.edu/event/145390,West Hall,267B,West Hall,,"Alumni

Fink, Ph.D., Northwestern University",Workshop / Seminar,"Organisms continually tune their perceptual systems to the features they encounter in their environment. We have studied how this experience reorganizes the synaptic connectivity of neurons in the olfactory (piriform) cortex of the mouse. We developed an approach to measure synaptic connectivity in vivo, training a deep convolutional network to reliably identify monosynaptic connections from the spike-time cross-correlograms of 4.4 million single-unit pairs. This revealed that excitatory piriform neurons with similar odor tuning are more likely to be connected. We asked whether experience enhances this like-to-like connectivity, but found that it was unaffected by odor exposure. Experience did, however, alter the logic of interneuron connectivity. Following repeated encounters with a set of odorants, inhibitory neurons that responded differentially to these stimuli exhibited a high degree of both incoming and outgoing synaptic connections within the cortical network. This reorganization depended only on the odor tuning of the inhibitory interneuron and not on the tuning of its pre- or postsynaptic partners. A computational model of this reorganized connectivity predicts that it increases the dimensionality of the entire network’s responses to familiar stimuli, thereby enhancing their discriminability. We confirmed that this network-level property is present in physiological measurements, which showed increased dimensionality and separability of the evoked responses to familiar versus novel odorants. Thus a simple, non-Hebbian reorganization of interneuron connectivity may selectively enhance an organism’s discrimination of the features of its environment.",https://events.umich.edu/event/144862,Biological Sciences Building,1060,Biological Sciences Building,,"Biology

However, in the first years of the last century, the infinitesimals were banned from the world of mathematics, as their use was considered contradictory. It was only in the 1960s, when Robinson introduced nonstandard analysis, that the use of infinitesimal and infinite numbers in calculus was finally placed on rigorous foundations.

In this talk, I will present some historical observations on infinitesimal numbers, and then introduce the fundamental ideas of nonstandard analysis. In the final part of the seminar, I will also show some applications of nonstandard analysis in the discrete field of combinatorics, presenting new results recently proven in arithmetic Ramsey theory, including the following: In every finite coloring (partition) of the natural numbers, one can always find a monochromatic pattern of the form a, b, a+b, b/a.",https://events.umich.edu/event/144702,East Hall,3088,East Hall,,Mathematics,"Logic Seminar - Department of Mathematics

Our goal is to create an accessible, supportive space for student-driven conversations where all identities and experiences are welcomed and in which students can build skills and tools around identifying goals and values and then communicate effectively about those. Workshops will be offered at multiple locations and times throughout the fall semester, so please sign up for the workshop that works for you!! First-Year Relationship Sexuality Talk (FYRST) FAQ:
“How many workshops do I have to sign up for?”
You only need to sign up for 1 workshop. Attending 1 workshop will fulfill the requirement for the training. 
“I see that there is more than one session, does it matter which one I sign up for?”
It generally does not matter which workshop you sign up for. There will be a few that are designated for specific groups such as transfer students or for students looking for accommodations. If you do not fit these groups please try to save these workshops for those that do and you are free to choose among any of the other workshops. 
“Is this workshop required?”
This workshop is required for all transfer and first-year students at the University of Michigan.
“I’ve experienced harm around relationships or sexual experiences in the past and I am worried that attending this workshop may be harmful for me.” 
Our team is aware that students who are coming into the university that have experienced harm in the past. Our workshop is specifically designed to respect and validate the experiences of survivors and has been carefully constructed to avoid any specific descriptions of violence and focus instead on themes of empowerment, communication, and boundary setting. However, if you still have concerns about programming and would like to request alternative programming, please feel free to reach out at SAPAC-FYRST@umich.edu.
“What if I struggle to learn in a presentation setting? I’m an active learner.”
Our workshop is built to meet a variety of learning styles, including time for self-reflection, small group sharing, and resources to take with you to work through on your own time! This workshop is meant to be interactive and inclusive. 
“Can I request accommodations?”
We considered accessibility in creating this workshop and selecting the locations in which the workshops are help. However, we recognize many places at the University are inaccessible and we've set an * next to workshops that are on the first floor and lack stairs. These workshops also will have a presentation (other workshops we do not) and are a good fit for those who might need a large font. Please sign up for those if you feel that accommodations would assist you and reach out to SAPAC-FYRST@umich.edu if you are concerned or have questions. 
“I missed my workshop, what should I do ?”
Our team tracks attendance at each workshop by having participants swipe in with their MCard. If you are not able to attend the workshop you signed up for, our team will continue to send reminder emails until you have completed a workshop. In this case, please sign up for another workshop as soon as you can as the workshop is required and may fill up especially near the end of the semester. No need to contact SAPAC unless you are not able to reschedule. 
“I have had gender-based violence training before, can I get this requirement waived?”
As this workshop was designed with University of Michigan student feedback in mind, our workshop is unique to the UM community.

For the 2025–26 academic year, Mediterranean Topographies (Meditopos) will be organized around the theme of home in the Mediterranean, which broadly includes domestic and private spaces. This interdisciplinary research workshop will explore domestic and private spaces not only as sites of personal and cultural significance but also as zones of political tension, displacement, surveillance, and resistance. How do personal experiences intersect with histories of migration, conflict, surveillance, and belonging? What does it mean to make, find, leave, or lose a home in times of political and climate instability? We will consider the meanings and materialities of ‘home’ across the Mediterranean region. From physical structures to affective attachments, we’ll explore how home is imagined, inhabited, and contested from diverse disciplinary perspectives. The workshop draws from multiple departments and programs at Michigan, including Comparative Literature, History, Anthropology, Middle East Studies, Romance Languages and Literatures, History of Art, Slavic Studies, English, and Classics, aiming to create a collaborative space linking across departments. We hope to foster interdisciplinary conversations about intimate, political, and symbolic dimensions of home in past and present Mediterranean contexts.",https://events.umich.edu/event/139243,,,AH G228,,Sessions,Sessions @ Michigan

GUEST ARTIST BIO

CAROL VANESS launched her professional singing career at the New York City Opera, where she appeared regularly from 1979 to 1983. Since then, she has sung on the world's biggest stages and at premier music festivals, collaborated with today's foremost conductors in operatic and symphonic repertoires, appeared on numerous television broadcasts throughout North America and Europe, and compiled a distinguished catalog of recordings. Her interpretations of Mozart's dramatic heroines, including Fiordiligi in *Così fan tutte*, Donna Anna and Donna Elvira in *Don Giovanni*, Elettra in *Idomeneo*, and Vitellia in *La Clemenza di Tito*, have been hailed as definitive, and she has become especially identifiable with the role of Floria Tosca. She performed the title role of Puccini's *Tosca* at the Metropolitan Opera in 2004 opposite Pavarotti in the legendary tenor's final operatic performance. Vaness made her professional debut as Vitellia for the San Francisco Spring Opera and has been acknowledged as the world's leading interpreter of this role. She has appeared as Vitellia at the Met Opera, Paris Opera, Royal Opera, Covent Garden, Chicago Lyric Opera and Gran Teatro del Liceo and at the Salzburg Festival and other leading theaters. Among her many celebrated television appearances, she has been featured on the *Pavarotti Plus* and *Pavarotti and Friends* telecasts from Lincoln Center, as well as the Richard Tucker Gala and *In Performance at the White House* with members of the New York City Opera.",https://events.umich.edu/event/145645,Earl V.

The workshop also introduces participants to on-campus resources and provides knowledge on how sexual misconduct can unfold in graduate-specific settings.The ERC workshop uses small-group circles intended to promote active reflection and space to build community. The procedure of circles is introduced at the beginning of the workshop in order to help participants get used to the process, which they do through a circle for introductions and value-sharing for the workshop space. These circles depict various, realistic scenarios related to sexual misconduct within the graduate community. The circle process allows circle members to process the monologues, reflect on complexities with identity and power dynamics within them, name potential barriers to intervention, and think of various ways in which they might respond if faced with similar situations. The circles provide a way to foster collective building of ideas, where participants learn from one another and all input is equally valued. Participants are encouraged to share but can always pass if desired, creating an environment where participation is open but not forced. Due to the participatory nature of the workshop, if you are to arrive more than 20 minutes late, we will ask you to re-register for another workshop session.If you have any questions about or concerns with taking this workshop, or are in need of an exemption, please contact jhippe@umich.edu or fill out this form. We know some students come to campus having already experienced harm. If you have circumstances that make completing this course challenging, please reach out to the GROPWE team. SAPAC GROWE provides exemptions to the ERC workshop (where requirements are set in place) on a case by case basis.

Amplitudes constitute an entire subfield of theoretical physics and are essential tools for experimental physics, from the  Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). In this talk, I will describe my research using “bootstrap” techniques and consistency principles to study the math and physics of amplitudes themselves. This work is part of the modern S-matrix bootstrap program, a framework for exploring the landscape of consistent quantum theories, including extensions of the Standard Model and theories of quantum gravity.

I will begin the talk with a brief history of particle physics and the S-matrix bootstrap program. I will then introduce several physical principles which constrain amplitudes, namely Lorentz invariance, analyticity, unitarity, and crossing symmetry. Finally, I will sketch a recent proof using these principles to bound the allowed masses and spins of particles in any consistent quantum theory. This talk will assume very little prior knowledge of particle physics, but I will use some complex analysis and group theory with a physicist’s level of rigor.

Long racialized as Russia’s Others, Crimean Tatars were rendered legible through colonial tropes that produced enduring aphasia within Slavic and East European studies. Emerging sites of encounter, mourning, and recognition since 2014 point toward a bifocal decolonial project that requires disentanglement from Russian imperial power while simultaneously confronting and unmaking colonial residues within Ukraine itself.

In principle, the redox sensitivity of U could also be leveraged in magmatic environments. Indeed, in silicate melts, U can occur in either the 4+, 5+, or 6+ valence state and information on magma oxygen fugacity (ƒO2) could be retrieved from U-bearing phases provided they can incorporate multivalent U during crystallization. In the first part of this talk, I will present how we used U XANES to probe the speciation of U in zircon grains from various localities, how we found that zircon can and do incorporate multivalent U in their structure, and how the relative proportion of U4+, 5+, and 6+ correlate with the ƒO2 of their host rocks. Having established U oxidations states in zircon as a new tracer of magma redox, in the second part of this talk I will then discuss how we applied this technique to zircon from the Jack Hills, Australia, how the cores and metamorphic rims of the investigated grains have distinct redox and trace elements systematics, and the novel constraints these results place on the nature of Hadean magmas and tectonic modes in the Hadean-Archean.",https://events.umich.edu/event/144907,1100 North University Building,1528,1100 North University Building,,Earth And Environmental Sciences,Earth and Environmental Sciences

Making Armenian Americans invites viewers into a moment of possibility in the early 20th century, when Armenians fleeing violence at the end of the Ottoman Empire came to reinvent themselves in the promise of America. Drawn from the archives of Project Save, these photographs capture different valences of American life, as experienced, performed, and imagined by Armenian immigrants. From naturalization classes to festivals of nations, from breaking new ground for churches to mundane tableaus of Thanksgiving and Christmas, this range of photographs offers a glimpse of a community in the making, one that sought to preserve a memory of its Ottoman past even while anticipating an American future.",https://events.umich.edu/event/143388,,,,,"Area Studies

*Back in Bahia: The Repatriation Journey of Afro-Brazilian Art from Detroit to Salvador* traces one of the largest repatriation efforts of Afro-Brazilian art to date. Led by the Detroit-based nonprofit Con/Vida: Popular Arts of the Americas, the initiative is returning more than 750 works of Afro-Brazilian popular art to Salvador, Bahia, where they will enter the collection of the National Museum of Afro-Brazilian Culture (MUNCAB). Built over three decades through sustained relationships with artists, families, and workshops across Northeastern Brazil, the collection reflects the creative ingenuity, community memory, and diasporic traditions that define Afro-Brazilian popular art.

This exhibition highlights selected works from the broader repatriation effort, recognizing the artists and cultural stewards in Brazil and Michigan who made this historic return possible. Featured are woodcut prints by João Francisco Borges, Nilo dos Santos, Givanildo Francisco da Silva, and José Miguel da Silva, alongside examples of *literatura de cordel*—popular printed booklets that combine social commentary, folklore, poetry, and song.

While the objects on display are disparate at first glance, ranging from lead tablets and amulets to papyrus and parchment leaves, they all share a common thread: they have long been labeled as ""magical"" in traditional Western scholarship.

However, each of these artifacts is better understood on a broad spectrum of ancient ritual, from subversive and transgressive acts to highly social and visible ones. The exhibit highlights the objects’ oft-overlooked material dimensions, asking us to consider how qualities like color, texture, and weight shaped an object’s perceived efficacy and meaning. 

This exhibit was a collaboration, and displays items from several University of Michigan units: the library’s Special Collections Research Center and Papyrology Collection, the Museum of Natural History, and the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology. It was curated by Abigail Staub, PhD Candidate, Interdepartmental Program in Mediterranean Art & Archaeology.

From September 2025 through August 2026, Stamps Gallery is partnering in a curatorial collaboration with two Ypsilanti-based, artist-run project spaces led by Stamps alumni: C.Y.N.K. Studios, directed by Sally Clegg (Lecturer III and Student Exhibition Coordinator, MFA ’20) and Abhishek Narula (MFA ’20); and Sometimes Space, directed by Nathan Byrne (Lecturer I, MFA ’21). Each space hosts dozens of artists annually for exhibitions, performances, and events, fostering experimental work and building community. For this project, Byrne, Clegg, and Narula have been commissioned to reimagine the pillars on Division Street that flank the gallery. In response, they’ve curated six artists to create new work for the pillars over three cycles:

Phase 1 (September 12 - December 12) artists: Amelia Burns (Cranbrook MFA ’23) and Erin McKenna (MFA ’20)
Phase 2 (January 12 - April 12) artists: Sally Clegg (MFA ’20) and Kim Karlsrud (MFA ’20)
Phase 3 (May 12 - August 12) artists: Abhishek Narula (MFA ’20) and Nathan Byrne (MFA ’21)
Phase 2 Curatorial Statement

Curated by Sometimes Space: Sally Clegg (entry pillar)
Curated by CYNK Studios: Kim Karlsrud (courtyard pillar)

Artists Sally Clegg and Kim Karlsrud wrap the Division Street pillars in highly site-specific ornament unearthed from the overlooked margins of Ann Arbor. On the Courtyard pillar, Karlsrud scales up photographs of objects found in liminal spaces surrounding campus buildings on Green Road, which the artist has encrusted in road salt. On the entryway pillar, Clegg zooms in on tiny fragments of found material from UMich’s famous “rock” to celebrate nearly seven decades of student art and activism. Both artists uplift aggregate of local human activity to reveal tiny worlds of found form. 

Sally Clegg: Sentimentary Rock
Sentimentary Rock is a composition of paint slag collected from the UMich rock monument at the corner of Washtenaw Avenue and Hill Street. This colorful composite material has been accumulating at the base of the iconic limestone boulder since the mid 1950’s, when students began a tradition of painting it in acts of protest, creativity, and ritual, sometimes multiple times per week. Akin to byproducts of industry such as “Fordite” (collectable chunks of automotive overspray sometimes called ‘Detroit agate’), Sentimentary Rock includes thousands of layers, each dripped from a palimpsestic public proclamation. When processed, sculpted, sealed, assembled, and macro-photographed, the result is this enlarged array of tiny gems, intended to celebrate the indissoluble student voice. 

Kim Karlsrud: What Amasses
What Amasses is an assemblage of everyday found objects collected within the Miller Creek watershed, an urbanized drainage system that encompasses much of the city of Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan campus. Selected objects were immersed in a road salt solution, allowing delicate crystalline formations to emerge. Road salt is a common material input into these hydrological networks during the winter months and exists in multiple states of refinement, expression, coherence, and fragmentation. Each object was then arranged, photographed, and enlarged to recontextualize these materials in ways that invite deeper reflections on how infrastructure and human agency blur notions of the natural and the artificial. 
Artist Statements/Bios

Sally Clegg 
Sally Clegg is an artist and educator from Pelham, Massachusetts. Her studio practice is rooted in sculpture and expanded printmaking, stemming from a fascination with human efforts to make meaning from our relationships to objects. Clegg integrates history, popular culture, literature and philosophy as material for artmaking, leveraging personal anecdote and humor to reveal the complexity, absurdity, and theoretical richness at play in our connections to things and to ourselves. 

Clegg holds an MFA in Art from The University of Michigan Stamps School of Art & Design, and a BA in Art & English from Goucher College. She has exhibited nationally and internationally, and her work can be found in permanent collections at Yale University, The New York Public Library, and elsewhere. Her artwork and writing has appeared in ASAP/Journal, BOMB Magazine, Sculpture Magazine, and Hyperallergic. She is a lecturer in Art & Design at the University of Michigan. Website / Instagram


Kim Karlsrud 
Kim Karlsrud is the co-founder of Commonstudio, a collaborative creative practice that develops socio-ecological and spatial interventions, installations, and initiatives working with and within urban landscapes. Her work explores the space between art and design, and is grounded in the concept of the “commons,” that which is shared, as well as that which is ordinary, banal, and commonplace.

Karlsrud completed her undergraduate degree in Product Design from Otis College of Art and Design and an MFA in Art from the University of Michigan. She is currently an Assistant Visiting Professor in the College of Design at the University of Oregon, teaching across Art and Landscape Architecture departments. She jointly received the 2014-15 Prince Charitable Trust Rome Prize in Landscape Architecture, was a 2017 resident at the Headlands Center for the Arts, and is the 2025-26 Fuller Fieldscape Fellow.

This production strives to honor our pasts, uplift our present voices, and imagine a collective future rooted in resilience, joy, and creativity.

LCS 2026 will create a blend between heritage and futurism by taking a look at the stories, music, and traditions which have shaped us while simultaneously envisioning how Latinidad will continue to grow and transform itself in the near future. This theme recognizes that our identities are not restrictive. It does not follow a “one size fits all” model but rather, encompasses a constellation of experiences and truths - ranging from the Afro-Latine and Queer identities to those of being first generation or indigenous - which are all connected and bridged through shared histories and dreams.

Latinidad Sin Fronteras invites our community to feel, remember, and imagine together – to truly explore and understand what Latinidad means when it is sin fronteras and free to become and transcend to what we desire and make it to be.",https://events.umich.edu/event/143932,,,GA -Michigan Theater,See Site For Pricing Information,"Mutotix

Curators: Michael Pifer (U-M| MES) and Kathryn Babayan (U-M|History)
Project Save Photograph Archive/Archive Alive Project

Making Armenian Americans invites viewers into a moment of possibility in the early 20th century, when Armenians fleeing violence at the end of the Ottoman Empire came to reinvent themselves in the promise of America. Drawn from the archives of Project Save, these photographs capture different valences of American life, as experienced, performed, and imagined by Armenian immigrants. From naturalization classes to festivals of nations, from breaking new ground for churches to mundane tableaus of Thanksgiving and Christmas, this range of photographs offers a glimpse of a community in the making, one that sought to preserve a memory of its Ottoman past even while anticipating an American future.",https://events.umich.edu/event/143388,,,,,"Area Studies

*Back in Bahia: The Repatriation Journey of Afro-Brazilian Art from Detroit to Salvador* traces one of the largest repatriation efforts of Afro-Brazilian art to date. Led by the Detroit-based nonprofit Con/Vida: Popular Arts of the Americas, the initiative is returning more than 750 works of Afro-Brazilian popular art to Salvador, Bahia, where they will enter the collection of the National Museum of Afro-Brazilian Culture (MUNCAB). Built over three decades through sustained relationships with artists, families, and workshops across Northeastern Brazil, the collection reflects the creative ingenuity, community memory, and diasporic traditions that define Afro-Brazilian popular art.

This exhibition highlights selected works from the broader repatriation effort, recognizing the artists and cultural stewards in Brazil and Michigan who made this historic return possible. Featured are woodcut prints by João Francisco Borges, Nilo dos Santos, Givanildo Francisco da Silva, and José Miguel da Silva, alongside examples of *literatura de cordel*—popular printed booklets that combine social commentary, folklore, poetry, and song.

While the objects on display are disparate at first glance, ranging from lead tablets and amulets to papyrus and parchment leaves, they all share a common thread: they have long been labeled as ""magical"" in traditional Western scholarship.

However, each of these artifacts is better understood on a broad spectrum of ancient ritual, from subversive and transgressive acts to highly social and visible ones. The exhibit highlights the objects’ oft-overlooked material dimensions, asking us to consider how qualities like color, texture, and weight shaped an object’s perceived efficacy and meaning. 

This exhibit was a collaboration, and displays items from several University of Michigan units: the library’s Special Collections Research Center and Papyrology Collection, the Museum of Natural History, and the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology. It was curated by Abigail Staub, PhD Candidate, Interdepartmental Program in Mediterranean Art & Archaeology.
