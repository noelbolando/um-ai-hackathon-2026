Amy Angell,Lecturer of Marketing,"Biography As a marketing lecturer, consultant, and small business coach, I am a firm believer in investing time in relationships. Through my work, I have had the opportunity to mentor peers, work with students on action-learning projects, and positively impact small businesses. But it took nearly 20 years to get here! ​ It was after many years of a successful sales career where I brought many new products to market and won several awards in market share growth, that I discovered two new loves- teaching and working with small businesses. Since 2007, I have enjoyed teaching many marketing courses, but the ones I love the most are consumer behavior and advertising.  As a result of these experiences, I developed a passion for hands-on learning and am known for pairing small business clients with student teams in order to create, develop, and implement problem-solving marketing strategies. In fact, the value received from clients prompted me to start my own consulting firm where I continue partnering with well-rounded college graduates, who I have personally mentored and who possess the skill sets to help brands grow. Our team includes content writers, graphic designers, researchers, media planners, and brand strategists. It’s a win-win: job opportunities for recent grads and customized and creative marketing solutions for small businesses. On a personal note, I've been married for 27 years and have four kids. I love to read, cook, and hang with family and friends. Many of my values come from my Catholic faith and my Kentucky roots, and some of my all-time faves include listening to country music, trips to Georgian Bay, and shoes!

Jeff DeGraff,Clinical Professor of Management and Organizations,"Biography Jeff DeGraff is the Dean of Innovation and one of the world's leading authorities on organizational innovation and transformational change. As Clinical Professor of Management and Organizations at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business since 1990, DeGraff has established a comprehensive school of thought around systematic innovation development that bridges academic rigor with practical application across business, government, and mission-driven sectors. DeGraff co-created the Competing Values Framework alongside Robert Quinn, John Rohrbaugh, and Kim Cameron—one of the most widely used organizational effectiveness models globally. Building on this foundation, he developed the Innovation Genome and Innovation Code methodologies, which extend the framework into innovation contexts and provide organizations with practical tools to reconcile competing priorities and drive breakthrough performance. His intellectual architecture centers on three revolutionary concepts: first, that innovation is a learnable skill, not a gift—a discipline that can be systematized like any business imperative; second, that constructive conflict, not harmony, drives breakthrough innovation by orchestrating opposing perspectives into hybrid solutions; and third, that transformational change emerges from embracing paradox rather than eliminating it. Through his trilogy of books—The Innovation Code, The Creative Mindset, and The Art of Change—DeGraff has codified a complete philosophy of paradox-based organizational transformation. DeGraff's career uniquely combines corporate leadership and academic excellence. After earning his PhD at age 25, he served as Vice President of Communications and New Ventures at Domino's Pizza (1985-1990), where he applied emerging organizational theories to help scale the company from $50 million to $2 billion—earning him the nickname ""Dean of Innovation."" This experience of building things, not just theorizing about them, has defined his approach as a ""pracademic"" who teaches innovation through action learning in unconventional spaces like museums and innovation laboratories. As founder of the Innovatrium Institute for Innovation, DeGraff created a living laboratory where organizations experiment with innovation culture, capability, and community. The Innovatrium operates as the practical manifestation of his school of thought—a physical space where diverse perspectives clash productively to generate new solutions. Through this work with over half the Fortune 500, including Google, Apple, Coca-Cola, Pfizer, NASA, and Microsoft, DeGraff has refined frameworks that help organizations build sustainable innovation ecosystems. Guided by his mission to democratize innovation, DeGraff founded the Intellectual Edge Alliance (IEA), a nonprofit consortium of research universities and technology companies working with the U.S. Military, NATO, and allied forces in 45 countries. Through the IEA, he makes innovation tools and practices accessible to leaders tackling critical societal challenges in defense, government, and education—proving that innovation methodologies transcend sector boundaries. DeGraff's influence extends through multiple channels: as creator of the University of Michigan's Certified Professional Innovator Program, the first university innovation certificate of its kind; as host of PBS's Innovation You and NPR's The Next Idea; and as a prolific contributor to Inc., Fortune, Psychology Today, and Big Think. His speaking engagements span from TED to the Pentagon, and his advisory work includes the U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff, Cabinet departments, and high-ranking military leaders across democratic nations. Through four decades of teaching, consulting, writing, and building innovation infrastructure, DeGraff has established himself as the preeminent voice on systematic innovation development and paradox-based organizational change. His school of thought transforms how organizations approach innovation—not as spontaneous creativity or rigid process, but as the disciplined orchestration of diverse perspectives, constructive tension, and the courageous embrace of organizational paradox to generate breakthrough value. jeffdegraff.com | https://www.linkedin.com/in/degraffjeff/ | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_DeGraff",https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jeff-degraff

Jordan Siegel,Jack D. Sparks-Whirlpool Corporation Research Professor of Business Administration | Professor of Strategy,"Biography Jordan Siegel is the Jack D. Sparks - Whirlpool Corporation Research Professor of Business Administration and Professor of Strategy at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. Professor Siegel specializes in the study of how companies gain competitive advantage through their global strategy.   Professor Siegel finds that there are numerous opportunities for companies to attain superior sustainable corporate performance through creative strategies for corporate governance and human resource management. A set of studies written by Professor Siegel explores how companies borrow, leverage, and arbitrage institutions across borders as a means of attaining long-term competitive advantage. By institutions Professor Siegel refers to the formal and informal rules of the game that affect companies’ competitive behavior and resource access. Formal institutions include corporate, securities, and bankruptcy law; informal institutions include a society’s cultural stance toward meritocracy and egalitarianism. (While a thorough list of rules of the game might be near-infinite, Professor Siegel concentrates on those that directly affect governance of companies.) The main idea is that companies—even single-country-focused companies—exhibit a surprising ability to attain competitive advantage via their choices of other countries’ institutions. Another set of studies written by Professor Siegel and his coauthors shows that companies can make their approach to the labor market a core component of their competitive advantage.  The goal has been to examine whether the hiring and promotion of female managers leads to improved corporate performance, whether foreign multinationals disproportionately engage in the hiring and promotion of female managers, and whether foreign multinationals act differently in the hiring and promotion of senior female managers in Japan and South Korea compared to what they do at home.  Overall, the results show that foreign multinationals have been the most active in both Japan and South Korea in exploiting the social bias and hiring and promoting women to senior management positions. Professor Siegel and his coauthors argue based on panel analysis with company fixed effects, and based on systematically ruling out alternative explanations, that the aggressive application of this outsider’s advantage has led to demonstrable improvements in performance over time for foreign multinationals in Japan and South Korea. Moreover, this source of competitive advantage is not short-lived, but appears to be as much as a decade-long opportunity. Professor Siegel’s work has been published in Management Science, Administrative Science Quarterly, the Strategic Management Journal, Organization Science, the Journal of Financial Economics, the Review of Financial Studies, the Journal of Comparative Economics, and the Journal of Economic Literature.",https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jordan-siegel

Siyu Yu,Assistant Professor of Management and Organizations,"Biography Siyu Yu is an Assistant Professor of Management & Organizations at the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan. Siyu's research centers on two fundamental social structures that pervade organizational life: social hierarchies and social networks. Her research revisits long-held assumptions about their implications, revealing overlooked liabilities and potential benefits by examining how these structures interact. At the individual level, she studies how individual differences in accurately perceiving status hierarchies (i.e., ""status acuity"")  influence workplace outcomes; how, when, and why advantageous networks yield both benefits and hidden costs; and how different bases of hierarchy—status and power—produce divergent personal consequences. At the team level, her work advances the conflict perspective of hierarchy by highlighting how team members’ mental representations of team environments can either amplify or mitigate dysfunctional intra-team dynamics. Her research has been published in journals such as Organization Science, Journal of Applied Psychology, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, and Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.",https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/siyu-yu
