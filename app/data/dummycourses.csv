ACCTG 310 Principles of Taxation (3) This course is directed to the study of concepts relative to: (a) the determination of taxable income and tax liability, (b) the influence of tax considerations on the decisions of taxpayers, and (c) elementary tax research techniques. Primary emphasis is given to concepts that are fundamental to the federal taxation of income with respect to business entities. Also, basic aspects of the taxation of individuals are introduced.The objectives of this course are to enable students to do the following: 1) apply basic tax rules and regulations to compute the taxable income and federal income tax liability for corporate and individual taxpayers, 2) incorporate tax costs and tax benefits into calculations of the net present value of cash inflows and outflows from taxable activities, 3) recognize tax planning opportunities or problems inherent in common transactions, and 4) appreciate the impact of the basis of accounting on both tax and financial reporting.Typical topics include sources of authority, structure of an income tax, property transactions, choice of entity, distribution of income, selection of jurisdiction, means of financing, and taxation of individuals. Students should be familiar with basic accounting concepts, should understand the nature of financial instruments, and should be able to apply the concept of present value and future value in estimating cash inflows and outflows.This is a required course for accounting majors and, for many of them, the only tax course that they take. Other students who meet the prerequisite requirements may take this course as an elective. Also, this principles course in taxation is a prerequisite requirement for an advanced course in taxation.Evaluation is based primarily on periodic examinations. No special facilities are required.

Although the course is intended for accounting majors, the content is relevant to finance majors seeking elective courses. The objective of the course is to provide students with a basic understanding of the concepts, terminology, and decision-making skills specific to the discipline of taxation that are germane to the professional development of those preparing for a career in accounting. Although the course surveys the many forms of taxation that are found in industrialized societies, and the comparisons thereof, the main focus is on the federal income taxation of individuals. However, coverage is provided regarding the manner in which the taxation of individuals relates to corporate and partnership entities. ACCTG 405 is related to other accounting courses through its coverage of income concepts, and micro-economic principles. The former compares differences in the measurement of financial accounting income with the manner in which income is determined according to the tax laws. The latter emphasizes business decision-making principles that are important in the managerial portion of the accounting program. The course covers topics that illustrate fundamental tax strategies and how such enable taxpayers to achieve business and personal economic objectives. The assessment process in ACCTG 405 incorporates examinations, homework assignments, and individual and group projects. The exams are combinations of objective questions and open-ended problems.

AERSP 405 Experimental Methods and Projects (3) This is a senior-level elective laboratory course that builds on AERSP 305 ""Aerospace Technology Laboratory."" The first part of AERSP 405 addresses the engineering of typical data acquisition systems through a series of lectures and laboratory experiments. Data acquisition and processing are covered as they relate to a broad range of engineering experiments. Several sessions in the laboratory provide students with hands-on experience with data acquisition, followed by computer program exercises to complete the assignments. Initially the lectures are twice a week (75 minutes each). This activity comprises approximately 20 % of the total course. The major portion of the course introduces students to ""real-world"" projects in engineering and laboratory research. Students work in teams to identify, formulate, plan and solve engineering problems associated with a design or system, the completion of an experiment, or an extensive computational simulation requiring a team of students. Teams of 2 to 4 students are assigned, following student input on preferences from a list of proposed projects. Students learn, through practice, the methodology of team project engineering. The teams each develop goals for the semester's project, performed following a careful work breakdown analysis with realistic time estimations and scheduling. Many of the projects involve the design and completion of an experiment. As part of the project, students will assemble, analyze and interpret relevant data, and prepare progress and final reports (written and oral). The reports should contain graphs that go with the text to provide the necessary data interpretation. The topics in the projects have application to a variety of research programs currently underway at Penn State. At the initiation of the project activity, lectures on principles of project planning including Gantt chart preparation, work breakdown structures and critical path considerations are presented. Common best practices for the preparation of project proposals, reports, presentations and general record keeping are discussed. Overall meetings with the course instructor become bi-weekly once the projects are underway. Many of the projects also have knowledgeable graduate student or faculty consultants to assist with project planning and implementation. Project consultants conduct occasional individual review meetings with each team. Much of the project coordination work is undertaken within the regularly scheduled hours for the course. The class meetings include a combination of informal presentations by the students and, occasionally, the instructor on important technical issues.

This course will examine the impact of slavery throughout the Americas, from the establishment of the plantation in Brazil through the impact of Black migration throughout the Americas today. Through lecture and discussion, we will identify patterns of racial identity and participation in the formation of the Latin American nation state that will give us a more nuanced understanding of both race and nation in the Americas. We will examine the development of the modern plantation from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century as well as the role of urban slavery in this era throughout Latin America. We will study the various paths to abolition with a particular focus on the Haitian Revolution and the common practice of military service among slave populations during the early nineteenth century struggles for Latin American independence. Additionally, we will look at the comparative abolition of slavery in the United States and Latin America, the role of slaves and free blacks in Central America, as well the role of race in the tensions between Haitians and Dominicans on the island of Hispaniola.

It has become a regular feature of Black History Month celebrated by community, neighborhood, and church groups as well as schools and institutions of higher education throughout the United States and elsewhere on a given Sunday and Monday in February attracting more than a million participants annually. This course offers students an engaged learning experience in which they will produce original intellectual and artistic content to be presented publicly at an AARI event on campus. Students will study texts from a range of historical periods and/or genres, and thus gain a solid introduction to the African American literary tradition. At the same time, the primary organizing principle of the course will be a particular theme that both allows a broad and coherent overview of a significant cultural or historical topic and engages issues of cultural diversity in the United States. The specific theme, thus, will bring the study of African American literature into a broader interdisciplinary context that intersects with African American culture, history, identity, and the struggle for equality. Students will study texts that relate to this annual theme and participate in a relevant field trip (museum, theater, cultural site, library, etc.) to deepen their understanding of the significance and contexts, social, historical, cultural, artistic of these materials and this theme. They will then develop this knowledge through creative and critical engagements into exhibitions, presentations, or performances to communicate their insights about a particular author, text, or topic in in the African American literary tradition.

Course readings will consist of both secondary and primary sources to explore the evolution of American policy toward the continent over the last half-century, and the meaning of the American engagement with Africa for American politics and society. The course will also examine the reasons that Africa has served as a focus of concern among African Americans both prior to, and, over the period 1945 to the present. Of particular concern will be the ways in which American policy has reflected pressures from African Americans as a constituency in foreign policy. The focus of the course will be student-centered written research and discussion. Students will be required to select topics from the course outline for presentation in class with the instructor serving as the moderator of discussion and guide to relevant research materials. Students will be encouraged to use both primary and secondary sources for their research. Students will be expected to prepare two individual written presentations which will serve as the basis for class discussion (30% of the grade), a book review (10% of the grade), and a research paper of 15 pages (40% of the grade) on a topic drawn from the areas identified in the course outline. The final 20% of the grade will be awarded for participation in class discussion.",3,3,Prerequisite:  3 credits in African history; 3 credits in African political   science; or 3 credits in American political science

137,AFAM 467,AFAM,467,,African American Novel II,"This course examines the African American novel, its forms, and its traditions starting during the Harlem Renaissance. It follows the genre's evolution into the twenty-first century, outlining the relationships among the texts that form the body of African American narrative as well as the relationships of those texts to the constantly shifting cultural and political realities surrounding their writing. From the Renaissance heralded by Alain Locke, through the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements -and their attendant Black Arts Movement- and into the era of the Movement for Black Lives, course readings encompass a broad range of styles and genres, from realism, naturalism, and naturalist primitivism, through the experimental forms, magical realism, and ""postrace aesthetics"" of later times. The course invites students to think critically about the African American novel as a socially and politically engaged form, and to identify and analyze the long tradition of resistance that variously informs its development. Authors covered in the course might include major figures such as Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, Nella Larsen, Wallace Thurman, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Ann Petry, James Baldwin, Ishmael Reed, Earnest Gaines, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Toni Cade Bambara, Octavia Butler, Gayle Jones, Samuel Delany, Charles Johnson, John Edgar Wideman, Colson Whitehead, and others. Still, the course gives due attention to lesser known/studied materials from the period, including graphic novels, satire, speculative fiction, performance novels, and various other experimental forms. Course readings and instruction give particular attention to how African American novels of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries variously engage social identity categories, like race, gender, class, and sexuality, and how they engage and resist various literary conventions associated with naturalism, modernism, and postmodernism. The course also traces the development of new thematic and aesthetic interests in a generation of writers whose fiction has been influenced by the explosion of interest in the graphic novel, the popularity of cultural forms such as hip hop, and the ascendancy of the digital age. Scholarly readings accompany primary texts to give students a sense of the critical work that has gone into and continues to go on in the study of African American literature. In this course, students learn how to analyze literature, do close and careful readings of texts, conduct related research, and write persuasively about literary works. Assignments and discussions are designed such that students may engage with course figures and materials within their historical milieus.",3,3,Prerequisite: ENGL 15 or ENGL 15A or ENGL 15S or ENGL 15E or ESL 15 or ENGL 30H or ENGL 30T or ( ENGL 137H and ENGL 138T )

""Introduction to Contemporary Africa"" offers students a view of contemporary Africa as a complex, significant, and richly diverse continent which has been heavily impacted by its colonial history. The course presents an introduction to African history, politics and cultures by drawing on intellectual resources from the continent combined with those from the rest of the world. The course aims to expand students' knowledge of intersecting cultures, histories, policies, and economics in a globalized world. The course provides students with an opportunity to deconstruct some of the influences and forces that have shaped and continue to shape modern Africa and thus providing students with an opportunity to investigate, explore and analyze the current local and global issues facing Africa. In this course the student will engage with some of the literature about contemporary Africa and develop skills at reading, analyzing, and writing within the interdisciplinary approach of African Studies. The overarching goal of this course is to help students understand contemporary African societies and their socioeconomic characteristics. The course provides students the opportunity to investigate Africa's multifaceted realities, explore: (1) The continent and its history; (2) Africa's dichotomous political, economic and institutional systems and their impacts and implications for governance and development; (3) The continent¿s social and environmental conditions and their impacts and implications on issues, such as demography, urbanization, gender relations public and social services and lastly; and (4) Characteristics of African culture whereby we explore African literature, theater, cinema, the arts, and belief systems.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: Other CulturesBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral SciencesInternational Cultures (IL)General Education: Humanities (GH)General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)General Education -  Integrative: InterdomainGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking

Poor African countries also have a range of peculiar characteristics that negatively affect their living standards. As these standards decline, western audiences have increasingly been targeted by aid organizations seeking donations to help the African cause. Despite growing awareness of African poverty, however, few attempts have been made to locate discourses on African poverty within historical, theoretical, and contemporary contexts. This course provides an overview of the key issues foundational for understanding the dynamics of poverty and human development in African societies. It examines various academic conceptualizations of poverty, the dimensions of poverty in African countries, as well as poverty¿s various causes and consequences. The course also intends to highlight the complex nature of the social, political, and economic causes of African poverty and their implications. Furthermore, it will identify the important challenges to poverty alleviation in African societies, the effectiveness of foreign aid, and alternative strategies to poverty alleviation. The course will also provide unique opportunities for students to develop a focused understanding of specific issues that affect Africa's socioeconomically vulnerable groups as well as related issues relevant for understanding the dynamics of poverty in specific areas on the continent.",3,3,Cross-listed with: SOC 209International Cultures (IL)General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)GenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking

PLSC 434 / AFR 434 War and Development in Africa (3) (IL) This course will examine the relationship between development and war in sub-Saharan Africa in the modern era. Specifically, it will analyze the extent to which the processes of state building, nation building, and international intervention have contributed to the incidence of both civil war and international conflict in Africa. We will begin with a review of several theoretical arguments on the causes of warfare in Africa and then turn to a discussion of theses on African political development. This course complements present offerings in international relations and comparative politics in the PLSC department and can serve as an advanced undergraduate offering in the African Studies concentration in AFR. The course directly complements our present offerings in international conflict given that we don';t have a regularly offered course that focuses on conflict in a specific region. In addition, it will augment our comparative politics offerings with an examination of prominent issues in comparative politics such as political development, democracy, and modernization. The course will fulfill the IL requirement and encourage students understanding of the historical background as well as the political, economic, and cultural factors that influence African politics. African conflicts are often viewed as ""ethnic conflicts"" and in this class students have an opportunity to assess the extent to which ethnic, linguistic, or religious factors influence the likelihood of conflict and contribute to development in African states. Students will also be required to write essays evaluating the contribution of a range of theoretical arguments on Africa';s conflicts in order to assess the degree to which cultural more than political or economic factors contribute to their onset. Students will then have the opportunity to conduct more extensive research on a specific African case to develop their analyses further. These exercises will often require that students reevaluate their beliefs about social identities such as race (e.g. in Rwanda the difference between Tutsi and Hutu is often viewed as a ""racial"" difference between black Africans, which is at odds with most Western conceptions of race). They also require students to challenge stereotypes regarding the subordination of African values in conflicts to a simple concern with ""tribe"". Students will gain a broader knowledge and appreciation of the different values, traditions, and cultures evident in Africa and understand how these can both exacerbate and mitigate conflict. Evaluation in the course will consist largely of examination of the students' brief expository essays and larger case studies for which students will be encouraged to conduct original research. The course should be offered biannually with a class limit of about 40 students.",3,3,"Prerequisite:  PL SC014 , PL SC003 , AFR  110"

GEOG 444 / AFR 444 African Resources and Development (3) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course is designed to analyze the ecological, economic, political and cultural factors, which influence development in sub-Saharan Africa. The traditional system, colonialism, modernization, post-colonial philosophies are four conceptual artifacts used to address some of these issues. Within these broad frameworks, the course focuses on existing debates surrounding key development ideologies and narratives in the region, including, poverty, conservation, population, debt, food security, land reform, foreign intervention and global politics. The topics and texts for the course are chosen carefully to provide general factual material as well as exposure to the major discourses surrounding the region's development. The views of many Americans concerning Africa are often both unitary (Africa is a country) and unidimensional (Africa is a place of conflict, poverty, corruption and crisis). Assuming that a number of students are likely to join the class with this general background, the main objectives of the course will be :  (i) to provide a broad geographic and historical tutorial to dispel myths and stereotypes about the region;  (ii) to explore the literature, which analyzes the historical, geographic and political factors that underlie the region's present status in the global economy; and (iii) to gain insights into the intellectual and ideological dimensions of the ""raging"" debates surrounding issues like environment, conservation, population, corruption, and poverty in the region. By the end of the semester, students should have acquired the skills to accomplish the following goals: *develop a ""mental map"" of the broad physiographic, ecological, economic and political zones (blocs) in the region; *be able to discriminate between stereotype and reality on information pertaining to the region; *be able to interpret and analyze the internal (national, regional) dynamics of the region's development; *be able to interpret and analyze the global factors, which influence the environment, economy, and politics of the region; *develop an informed background on the ideological narratives that guide policy in the region, for example, population, sustainable development, post-colonialism, ""empire"" (whether, American, European, Indian, Chinese, South African?).",3,3,Prerequisite:  GEOG 010 or GEOG 020 or GEOG 030 or GEOG 123 or GEOG 124 or GEOG 130 or EARTH105 or AFR  105 or AFR  110

In this course, we will discuss the current democratization trend in Africa by focusing on the experiences of African countries.The course is divided into three sections. Part One considers a range of factors that affect politics in Africa. We will discuss in depth the following factors: colonialism, nationalism, the relationship between state and society, ruler-ship, the military, political parties, and economic development. Then, we will consider the experiences of our four cases, to gain a historical background. In part two, we will focus on democratic transitions. We will discuss the factors that enable transitions to occur, as well as the process that transitions follow. Then, we will consider four transitions: two that resulted in the installation of a democratic government (Nigeria in 1979, Sudan in 1986) and two that ended in continued authoritarianism (Angola in 1992, Kenya in 1978). Part three considers the prospects of democracy. We will discuss the probability of a democratic transition occurring in the near future.The goals of this class are four fold. First, students will gain detailed knowledge about four African countries. Second, we will learn how to compare countries. Third, students will have a better understanding of the democratization process in general, and will be able to explain or predict democratization beyond the four cases discussed in this class. Finally, the experiences of these four countries offer a deeper understanding of what democracy is and provide students with greater flexibility to fulfill requirements in either the African and African American Studies major or the Political Science/International Politics major.

Of course our knowledge of the biology and ecology of weedy plant populations will then be used to underpin and assess control tactics and their integration. The discipline has a history of equating management with herbicidal control and in fact some 80% of the pesticides used in U.S. agriculture are herbicides. However through novel farmer designed management systems, through a research community focused on alternative methods of management and through increased focus on invasive species, exciting breakthroughs are occurring in alternative methods of management and prevention. This course seeks to introduce you to the breadth of management approaches in use and under study. The specific objectives are for students to describe and identify: 1) the local weed flora, 2) the fundamental aspects of weed biology and ecology relevant to managed landscapes, 3) the control methods used in managing weed populations, 4) how control measures can be integrated to accomplish acceptable levels of pest suppression, 5) operationalizing a weed management plan, 6) how herbicides enter and move to their site of action in plants, 7) classifying herbicides by their site of action, and 8) the distinction between herbicide concentration in soils and plant available herbicide concentration.",4,4,Prerequisite: AGRO 28 or HORT 101;  RECOMMENDED PREP SOILS 101

All of these trends -- biological, demographic, and cultural -- are viewed from the perspective of evolution away from our earliest human patterns, toward the effects of demographic density and sociocultural complexity. The course takes a question-oriented approach to show the relevance of anthropology in today's world. Lectures are structured around what it means to be human -- from a perspective of either biological anthropology, sociocultural anthropology, archaeology, or linguistics. Overall the course has three main goals: 1) provide an introduction to anthropology's subject matter, human cultural and physical characteristics, throughout our species' geographical and chronological range; 2) introduce students to some of the biological, ethnographic, archaeological, and linguistic methods that anthropologists rely on to reach their conclusions; and 3) impart a framework of knowledge that will facilitate understanding of one's own place in human history, in the larger culture, community, family, and household.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: Other CulturesBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral SciencesInternational Cultures (IL)General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)GenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason
449,ANTH 9N,ANTH,9,N,Rise of Civilization in the Old World,"ANTH 9N introduces students to the anthropology of early complex societies in the Old World, with an emphasis on the civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley and China. Course information emphasizes the nature of these societies, analysis and interpretation of their basic institutions, their religions and world views, and their culture histories. Within the context of each segment sociological concepts such as ""institution"", ""household"", ""stratification"", ""political economy"", ""urbanization"", and a host of others are used as organizing features. Issues of gender, ethnicity, and class structure are also discussed, and much information is presented in weeks 2 and 3 that is pertinent to an understanding of human biological variation and our cultural attitudes toward it, with obvious implications for issues of race. The course is much broader, however, in that it attempts to place the emergence of these ancient civilizations into the overall perspective of the larger evolutionary career of the human species in the Old World, including human biological and cultural evolution during the later stages of the Paleolithic, the origins and spread of early agriculture, etc. During the first part of the course there is also a series of introductory lectures designed to inform students about what archaeology is and how prehistoric archaeologists carry out scientific research to reconstruct and explain what happened in the past. A great deal of emphasis is placed on ideas, concepts, and theories used by anthropological archaeologists to design and interpret their research and to explore not only what happened in the past, but to develop ideas about why things happened as well. Also included are lectures about archaeological finds or issues that have been particularly well publicized and about which students often express considerable curiosity. The main objectives are a) to expose students to a series of historically significant non-modern, non-Western societies and cultures using overtly evolutionary, behavioral, and sociological perspectives; b) to enlighten students concerning the kinds of extant information that are available for these societies, how research is designed to acquire new data, and how scholar's interpret these data, and c) to stress the nature of the agrarian human condition out of which modern societies so recently emerged, and under which people in many developing societies still live. Central to the latter are issues of subsistence agriculture and human demography. Central to ANTH 9 are comparisons among several great Old World civilizations, comparisons with other world civilizations and cultures, and comparisons with modern society.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesBachelor of Arts: Other CulturesBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral SciencesInternational Cultures (IL)General Education: Humanities (GH)General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)General Education -  Integrative: InterdomainGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking
452,ANTH 22,ANTH,22,,Humans as Primates,"Humans as Primates is intended to introduce the student to the biological bases of human anatomy and behavior by drawing comparisons to the behavior and biology of our closest living relatives, the non-human primates. The principal goal of the course is to critically evaluate arguments concerning what uniquely makes us human and the role of genetics, environment, and evolutionary history on the development of human behavior and anatomy. The course will draw heavily on studies of living non-human primates as well as evolutionary theory, paleoanthropology, and evolutionary psychology to address issues such as human growth and development, dietary adaptations, human variation, human communication, intelligence, reproduction, violence and aggression, and culture. Humans as Primates is divided into four main thematic units each designed to present a set of related lessons exploring the role of biology in various aspects of human life. The first unit provides the foundation for the course by introducing the place of humans in the natural world. This unit presents a survey of living primates and their relationship to humans as well as an overview of evolutionary processes and human evolution. The other units present topics in human biology, communication, and social behavior focusing specifically on topics of importance to current events and aspects of popular culture and modern life. This course should be of significant interest to students in a diversity of disciplines including the biological and social sciences as well as anyone interested in human behavior. The course can be used to fulfill three credits of General Education in the Natural Sciences (GN). As such this course will help students understand how scientific information from a variety of disciplines can be used to investigate and understand human biology and behavior. The course will introduce the student to methods of data collection and analysis, foster critical thinking skills, and provide a rich background for understanding human diversity, human biology, and behavior.

455,ANTH 45N,ANTH,45,N,Cultural Diversity: A Global Perspective,"ANTH 45N (Cultural Diversity: A Global Perspective) is designed to introduce students to the concepts and evidence used in understanding the cultural diversity of our planet. ""Culture"" can be defined as a socially transmitted system of shared conventions, beliefs, practices, and behavior. Cultural systems vary across time and space, and dynamic cultural processes are involved in how humans interact with each other, other organisms, and the environment. This class provides students with the tools to approach questions about the diversity of human cultures, how they vary across different societies, how different people experience and represent social worlds, why they change, and the importance of understanding such variability for the global challenges we face in an ever-changing world. Anthropology takes as its subject the entirety of the human experience, in all of its diversity through time and space. Anthropology thus provides a unique perspective for understanding our increasingly complex and diverse contemporary world. Specifically, ANTH 45N has three goals: 1) Introduce students to anthropological approaches for describing variability in systems of shared human thought, belief, and social practice. 2) Utilize anthropological concepts and evidence to evaluate factors that shape the diversity of cultural systems over time and space. 3) Provide students the opportunity to explore the dynamic interaction between contemporary cultural systems, histories of change, and the physical environment. ANTH 45N is designed to integrate two General Education Domain fields: the Social and Behavioral Sciences (GS) and the Humanities (GH). The course integrates different methods of inquiry and different forms of knowledge about the many factors that interact to influence patterns of convention, practice, and diverse ways of life. ANTH 45N enables students to develop competency for integrating knowledge across different domains and interpreting the human experience through multiple social, historical, and environmental perspectives. Students thus gain skills in evaluating their own values relative to the broad context of diverse ways for understanding the world. To achieve these educational objectives, ANTH 45N draws on multiple teaching formats and resources, including classroom lectures and discussions, readings from general textbooks and primary literature, critical analysis of ethnographic film, and online written materials and podcasts.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: Other CulturesBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral SciencesInternational Cultures (IL)United States Cultures (US)General Education: Humanities (GH)General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)General Education -  Integrative: InterdomainGenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason

Beginning about 10,000 years ago, humans in China and the Middle East became more sedentary and began to rely more on the food they grew than from hunting and gathering. The cereal grains these early societies relied upon, such as rice, wheat, and barley, soon formed the basis for the first alcoholic beverages. Relying on ethnographic, biological, linguistic, and archaeological data, the course will introduce students to what we now know about how humans created and currently use fermented beverages across cultures. The course introduces students to the basic concepts of anthropology by highlighting the variability of alcohol use through time and space. From the world's first beer in Henan, China in 7000 B.C. to modern breweries in Pennsylvania the class will explore the historical and societal impacts of alcohol production. From the ceremonial use of distilled sugarcane in southern Mexico to ritualized tailgating in the United States, students will be presented with the highly varied ways in which alcohol is consumed. Anthropology of Alcohol provides students with an understanding of the origins of one of the world's earliest and most utilized psychoactive drugs as well as an appreciation for some of the contemporary challenges of alcohol use on college campuses in the US.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral SciencesInternational Cultures (IL)United States Cultures (US)General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)GenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason

In doing so, the course draws from in integrates findings from a wide array of disciplines, including evolutionary biology, genetics, neuroscience, endocrinology, behavioral ecology, anthropology, and psychology. After honing their evolutionary skills by investigating reproduction in other species, students will apply evolutionary principles to understanding human mating. Why do we prefer certain characteristics in a mate? How do these preferences differ between and within the sexes, and why? How do mating behaviors vary across cultures, and why are some behaviors more culturally variable than others? Other topics covered include infidelity, sexual jealousy, concealed ovulation, sexual conflict and rape, orgasm, parental care and abuse, and menopause. In understanding the evolutionary basis for a trait, it is helpful to understand its development. Thus, this course also covers the basics of sexual differentiation and investigates how variation in these processes might lead to variation in sexual orientation and gender identity.

ANTH 221N Ancient Maya Civilization (3) (GS;GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Great civilizations emerged independently in several parts of the world beginning about 5500 years ago. Most students have had some exposure to the great Old World civilizations (Mesopotamia, Egypt, China), but know comparatively little about their counterparts in the New World. Among these, the Classic Maya (AD 250-900) are the most familiar, and are heavily featured in popular culture. Many students have (or will) visit Maya sites as tourists, and be impressed by the flamboyant archaeological remains of these ancient people. Despite their visibility, the Maya are widely misunderstood and heavily sensationalized. ANTH 221N traces the development of ancient Maya culture from about 10000 BC through its eventual conquest by the Spaniards in the 16th century. The primary focus will be on the Classic period, when Maya civilization achieved unparalleled heights in architecture, art, astronomy, mathematics, and writing. The course content makes extensive use of images of sites, artifacts, and artwork to introduce and immerse students to the particularities of the Ancient Maya worldview. The Maya were participants in a much wider tradition of complex civilization in the region archaeologists call Mesoamerica, and several lectures will place them in this more general context. A good amount of content in this course will come from research done by members of the Penn State Anthropology Dept., which has a long tradition of Mesoamerican/Maya research since the early 1960s, and has heavily influenced both the study of Mesoamerican societies and complex cultures in general. Content and topics in the course will also situate Maya peoples, both ancient and modern, in relation to important topics in the contemporary world such as environmental sustainability and degradation, ethnic identity, and state formation.

The impacts of environmental change on human societies, and the roles those societies play in ecological modification, have deep roots in human evolution. This class focuses on providing students with tools to understand the foundations and cross-cultural expressions of resource use, environmental transformation, and their ecological interactions. The class has three goals: 1) introduce students to ways of thinking about ecological and social factors that shape variability in how humans define, use, and consume resources, 2) provide students the opportunity to explore archaeological, ethnographic, and ecological evidence of the interaction between human livelihoods and habitats across the entirety of the human experience, 3) utilize those concepts and evidence to investigate variability in contemporary livelihoods, socio-ecological systems, and the dilemmas we all face in natural resource use and sustainability. Regarding the first goal, students are introduced to the natural science of conservation biology and community ecology, along with influential concepts in the social science of decision-making and cultural institutions of resource management. We review key models of ecosystem dynamics and social interaction from evolutionary ecology, disturbance ecology, niche construction, common property theory, and political ecology to approach questions about consumption, complex socio-ecological systems, and the role of humans in food webs and trophic interactions. The course then investigates archaeological and paleo-ecological evidence concerning the evolution of human subsistence systems, global settlement, intensification, and their implications for understanding environmental change over the last two million years. We take the broadest possible anthropological approach: we explore the diversity of ways that humans have made a living in the past, and investigate a wide variety of contemporary systems of resource use. We begin with the emergence of subsistence regimes among the earliest members of our genus and variability in environmental conditions through the Pleistocene. We then discuss the spread of modern humans and arguments concerning the ecological impact of people in the New Worlds as humans first colonized Australia, the Americas, and islands of Pacific and Indian Oceans. Finally, students investigate contemporary Indigenous systems of resource use and food production, exploring interactions between people and culturally constructed environments, commensal relationships between humans and non-human plants and animals, processes of intensification, and ecosystem function. The course incorporates these concepts with studies of inequality into new ways of understanding global issues of conservation, economics, and policy impinging on environmental change.",3,3,General Education:  Natural Sciences (GN)General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)General Education -  Integrative: InterdomainGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking

To answer this question, we approach it from multiple perspectives: biological, evolutionary, ecological and social. In this course, students will investigate how food tastes, preferences, and diets of different individuals and societies both in the past and present are affected by genetic variation, by processes of individual and cultural learning, by evolutionary and ecological forces and histories of ecological and social interaction, by existing social contexts and structures, and by global political and economic forces. Topics include a broad survey of human and nonhuman primate diets and their physiological and behavioral correlates; theories of optimal diet breadth and prey choice; fossil and archaeological evidence for early human diets; genetic adaptations to diet; metabolic syndrome; food security; food taboos; the origins and cross cultural uses of spices; ecological impacts of hunting, gathering, and agropastoralism especially relative to food webs, biodiversity and sustainability; cultural diversity in the social uses and meanings of food and the sharing of food and how sociopolitical contexts have shaped the overexploitation of certain resources throughout history. Students will come away from this course with an understanding of the diversity of human foodways through time and space: how biology, culture, and ecology interact to shape the food we eat, and how the food we eat shapes us.",3,3,RECOMMENDED PREPARATIONS: ANTH 21; ANTH 45

ANTH 424 Andean Ethnology and Archaeology (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Andes in 1532, they were astonished by the complexity and grandeur of the Inca Empire, which stretched along western South America incorporating a multitude of different societies that occupied a seemingly inhospitable landscape with coastal deserts, rugged mountain chains, and dense jungles. This course traces out the history and development of Andean cultures from the earliest peopling of the continent to the rise and fall of the Inca Empire. Using archaeological, historical, and ethnographic sources, students will learn about the relationship between Andean societies and their environments and landscapes, as well as the economic, social, and political changes that transformed small egalitarian communities through time into large, stratified states. Through the course, students will not only gain a strong background in pre-Columbian Andean history but will also hone their skills in the use of different lines of evidence to reconstruct the past while learning to critically evaluate existing interpretations. All students are expected to participate actively in discussions. Lectures will be supplemented by illustrations (slides, handouts, videos), and students will learn how societal dynamics are expressed in material culture and in the organization of architecture and settlements. Grades will be based on the results of three exams, a short paper, and participation in discussions.

ANTH 435 Ancient Economy (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course examines the origin and development of ancient economy from its earliest beginnings to the advent of complex monetary economies that existed prior to the industrial revolution. It examines the common economic structures found in ancient foraging, pastoral, and agricultural societies and how those structures were modified and transformed as these societies were integrated into more complex monetary economies. The goal of the course is to develop a comprehensive understanding of ancient economies, the function and purpose of their economic structures, and how those structures of production and distribution were modified and retained within the modern economies that we live in today. While the economy is often approached as its own field of study, this course shows how and why the economy was embedded in social, political and religious institutions that were so prominent in the ancient past. The course will discuss the domestic and institutional economy, the origin and organization of ancient market systems, the development of urban centers and the economies that supported them, the role of merchants in ancient societies, and origins of many of our 21st century institutions including money, banking, insurance, and the organization of craft production before the industrial revolution.The class draws upon the rich literature in archaeology, history and ethnohistory that examines the structure of ancient societies. It employs a cross-cultural perspective to model ancient economies and to investigate how social forces influenced their development. A range of different historic and prehistoric societies are discussed each semester to illustrate the cross-cultural perspective. The societies discussed vary from semester to semester and include, but will not be limited to, the ancient Sumerian, Assyrian, Greek, Roman, Mongol, Aztec and Inka societies. Examples will be selected that include societies at different scales of complexity from simple hunting and gathering groups to pre-industrial states.The course fulfills the Social and Behavioral requirements in Liberal Arts. It also fulfills specific major and minor requirements for the BA in Anthropology, the BS in Archaeological Sciences, and the BS in Bioanthropology.

JST 457 / ANTH 457 / SOC 457 Jewish Communities: Identity, Survival, and Transformation in Unexpected Places (3) (US;IL) This course addresses an understudied aspect of Jewish experience. It aims to expand our understanding of Jewish communities by focusing on those that are, alternatively, small, situated in out-of-the-way places, culturally outside the Jewish urban mainstream, or embedded in a larger society with markedly different values and traditions. These communities often constitute the points-of-contact between Jews and non-Jews, and in so doing sometimes transform Jews, non-Jews, and the relationships among them. Other such communities constitute experiments in Jewish lifeways and provide mainstream Jews with pilot projects for potential social and cultural change. This course will explore the significance of small, little-known, idiosyncratic, and anomalous Jewish communities on Jewish history and culture, and draw on them to instruct students on the social and cultural processes of small or unusual communities generally. The communities studied will be located both in the U.S. and elsewhere in which Jews have lived as a minority community during modern times. The course will look at the founding, growth, and decline of such communities and at their social processes and institutions. It will explore how to understand and analyze such communities, which vary from one part of the world to another. The social world of Jewish communities, large and small, is a core interest of Penn State's Jewish Studies Program. This course will complement the current offerings in Jewish Studies, strengthening the social, cultural, and contemporary perspectives available in the Program. It will provide students with an opportunity to explore individual experience and micro-level processes among Jews, and to study the dynamics of identity and survival. It will complement the current offerings in Sociology and Anthropology by affording an opportunity to focus on community-level social processes and by adding a course on contemporary Jewry. The course will integrate knowledge from a variety of sources and fields, promote intercultural understanding, and meet US and IL requirements. Materials will be interdisciplinary, and will include ethnographies, sociological studies, population studies, histories, and personal narratives. They will include primary texts, creative works, and scholarly analyses. The assignments will be structured to facilitate preliminary experience in independent analysis, library research, or field research. The course will be offered approximately once a year.

ANTH 466 The Skull (3) This course will provide a survey of what is known about the Mamallian skull from many perspectives including evolution, development, anatomy, function, and variability of the skull. The course will consist of lectures and a laboratory component. Students will learn about the basic skull architecture and be introduced to various specializations of extinct and extant species. The section on evolution will cover the evolution of the skull from the earliest jawless vertebrates through human evolution. During the section on development, we will discuss the nature of the formation of bone embryologically. Other topics include the ways in which bone changes shape and size during prenatal and postnatal growth, how changes in growth can result in evolutionary change in morphology. The section on the function of bone will focus on biomechanical interpretations of the morphology of the skull. The lectures will focus on human anatomy but provide contrasts with other mammals (e.g., horse, dog, mouse). The last section on variability will survey the major groups of mammals highlighting similarities and differences in bony architecture and skull morphology. This portion of the course will be more laboratory-based with students examining specimens, taking measurements and leading discussions on hypotheses regarding why skull architecture is so different among mammals. The objective of this course is to provide the student with a broad survey of information relating to the mammalian skull. Through assigned readings and lectures the student will become familiar with salient anatomical and osteological features, obvious differences in skull architecture and the various biological processes responsible for these differences. During the final laboratory part of the course the students will bring their knowledge to an assigned problem and specimen in order to apply what they have learned to a scientific question. Students will be required to attend all lectures and laboratories. Periodic quizzes will be administered as well as an exam at midterm.

This means studying how language serves to represent and to constrain  speakers in various social and cultural contexts. The activity of using language will be viewed through the lens of several research domains in the field of Applied Linguistics, a discipline that studies language in the way that real speakers and writers actually use it. The class will present readings taken from fields as varied as sociolinguistics (language as social performance); second language acquisition research (language as cognition, language as participation); language and identity; pragmatics (speech, act theory; conversational analysis); and language and power (language an power (language policy; gender and language). Whether being studied as a formal school subject or learned at a mother's knee, language is in extricabley bound up with who we are and who we become. Theoretical terminology, research-based findings, and innovative ideas about what language 'really' is will be introduced and explored through accessible and engaging readings and activities. Students will learn to look at language use in social contexts from multiple perspectives, seeing how it both reflects, and shapes, identity in context (while at the same time allowing speakers to modify and shape those very contexts). Given that this is a first-year class for first-semester students, emphasis will be placed on how the understanding these basic ideas of Applied Linguistics can help us to pursue a satisfying and enriched sense of self, whether as a speaker of a specific language, or as a member of multiple discourse communities. Students will conduct an interview project to better understand the issues faced by language learners in the local community.

This course will explore how the intersection of knowledge domains from the social sciences and the humanities can enrich our understanding and appreciation of multilingualism, including its challenges and its intellectual benefits. The class will first read and analyze stories about growing up in bi- or multilingual families, immigration in childhood or adulthood, and voluntary learning of languages at home or abroad. Along the way, we will encounter questions about the relationship between language, culture and personal identity as well as questions about the ways in which gender, power, and social class influence our pathways in pursuit of a satisfying sense of self. The stories we read will be interspersed with formal inquiry in second language acquisition, bi- and multilingualism, and language education, such as: How can we understand the processes of language acquisition and attrition? How do individual differences such as age or motivation influence learning? What are the documented cognitive benefits of bilingualism? The class will then conduct a community outreach project, collecting and analyzing stories from multilinguals who may be members of their own families, recent or longer-term immigrants, international students, scholars or retirees, foreign language learners, heritage learners, or parents of bilingual children. This project will encourage students to interrogate lived experiences as objects of study.

Students are introduced to the characteristics of the consonant and vowels systems of English. In addition, students are introduced to variations in the production of consonants and vowels by speakers of languages other than English. Students are expected to understand and to be able to describe the stress rhythm, and intonation of English as well as the adjustments that are made in connected speech. Students will learn how grammar and orthography influence the pronunciation of phonemes. Students will learn how to diagnose an individual's difficulties in the production of North American English and will learn how to develop appropriate curriculum. By focusing on instructional strategies from fields as diverse as theater arts, psychology, and instructional technology, students will be able to individualize their instruction by providing alternative ways to better respond to second language speakers' learning styles and preferences. Moreover, this course requires students to develop and implement appropriate curriculum for both hypothetical, real tutorial, and whole class instruction.The objectives of this course are for teachers 1) to develop a satisfactory understanding of the phonetics of North American English, including consonants, vowels, rhythm, stress, intonation and prominence, 2) to develop an understanding of the relationship between listening and pronunciation, as well as orthography and pronunciation, 3) to develop an ability to explain these phonetic concepts appropriate to students with varying learning styles using a variety of techniques such as kinesthetic and tactile reinforcement, 4) to develop an ability to diagnose speakers' particular pronunciation difficulties and to create instructional materials in response, 5) to develop a coherent philosophy of the teaching of pronunciation, and 6) to develop an ability to evaluate pronunciation textbooks and materials and supplement them when necessary.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences

ARAB 3 is an intermediate course designed as a continuation of ARAB 2 and a basis for further study of Arabic as a second or foreign language. The course intends to alert students to the wealth and intricacies involved in learning the Arabic language and its many cultures. In addition to being the official language of 22 countries, with great ancient civilizations, complex modern histories, and intense political situations, Arabic is also the language of the Islamic religion; the language of a booming music and film industry, and the language of a significant body of literature. The multiplicity of the Arabic language, as well as the coexistence of colloquial and modern standard Arabic, is addressed in this course. The course emphasizes all four communication skills (reading, speaking, listening and writing). Vocabulary and grammar are expanded. Students become involved in the Arabic language and its cultures through various activities, which may be designed around a serialized and audio-visually enhanced story set in an Arabic environment, as well as through an oral report presented in class. The course may use popular media such as films, comics, newspaper articles, music, websites, and songs. Themes relating to contemporary experience are treated, such as relationships with family members and friends, the decision to immigrate, daily life within a residence, how a child of an Arab immigrant feels, the cultural importance of hospitality, and the month of Ramadan. The course is designed for students who have completed ARAB 2 in Penn State's language sequence or have the equivalent level of language proficiency.

Some problems and questions are exemplary of their times; others seem eternal as we continue to grapple with them today. Changes in our ideas and ideals are made visible in our built environment, giving us a unique opportunity to trace their trajectories across time to see 'how we got to now.' The course introduces architectural and urban ideas by exploring and connecting key directions, works, and texts from the Western tradition. By casting a critical eye on where we've been, the course opens new perspectives on what might be next. The course covers a period ranging from ancient Greece and Rome to the present, with emphasis on how the foundations of Western architecture collided with modernity, and how we've dealt with the hereafters of modernity since the mid-20th century.

Since most architecture is set in cities and the city is itself an architecture, it becomes necessary for us to evaluate the relationships that affect the making of buildings for cities and the organization of buildings into a meaningful whole. This course will explore the two meanings of the term ""the architecture of cities"". It will propose questions leading to an analytical de-composition of the situation of cities in general and Rome in particular. The course is loosely divided into three sections. The first, Historical Overview, presents the evolution of early settlements focusing on the significance of built form. The second, Revolutions and Modernity, demonstrates the qualitative shift in emphasis that settlements undergo from the Enlightenment, through the Industrial Revolution, to the Information Revolution. The third section, the Current Debate, will present some contemporary issues and techniques proposed for the resolution of apparent problems of city architecture. Since this course is given in a unique setting, it takes full advantage of Rome, its history and its problems, to highlight the universal design elements that are part of an analytical understanding, but also of a synthetic design understanding of cities. This course is theory based and, as such, will provoke thinking, a taking apart mentally, more than a making of architecture. The studio design problem, also set in this city, is the operative dimension of thoughts generated here.

Approaches to Digital Art is a survey class that will offer the web designer, cyberspace architect, MUD traffic controller or enthusiastic surfer an opportunity to examine the humanistic aspects of contemporary digital art. Through readings and direct interaction with digital media and digital artists, the class will develop an appreciation of the ways in which the interface between human beings and technology has been historically constructed and is subject to critical investigation. The goal of the class is to prepare each student so that she or he may engage with digital media in a way that is every more historically and socially self aware.Students will address the ways in which digital technologies transform artistic practices such as museum display, the writing of art criticism, the definition of works of art, changing role of the artist and the changing space of the art studio. More important, however, by engaging with digital works of art students will learn to think critically about technology and its engagement with culture at large. They will be encouraged to think about the political, economic and social impact of digital technologies. This humanistic approach to technology would make this course particularly useful to students of art history, philosophy, comparative literature, art education, and the visual/plastic arts. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to the ways in which art on the internet and digital art in general challenge the integrity of categories such as race and national identity. For example, students will have an opportunity to engage with African American artists such as Keith Obadike, whose on-line performances include an attempt to put his ""blackness"" up for sale on ebay.com in August of 2001. Students may also look at the ways in which net.art (Art made to be viewed on the internet) can critique commercial cooptation of global culture: etoy.com, for example, is an international and collaborative artist's group that satirizes global capital by camouflaging itself as a multinational corporation.This class will depend largely upon written responses and class discussion, rather than upon tests. Thus, students will learn how to approach difficult theoretical sources that have been assigned to them, and they will learn how to ask the kinds of questions that will help them understand such sources. This course will emphasize critical thinking rather than memorization, so students will develop analytical skills that will be useful in many other contexts.

In addition to being a survey of major monuments in art, the course is also intended as an introduction to the field of art history: to its studies of artistic style, iconography (the study of subject matter and its meaning), patronage and contextual history. Art history not only studies the formal elements of art, like the use of color and line, but also analyzes the historical circumstances (social, political, economic) that surround the production of art, and it questions the meaning of works of art for viewers of the time and for later generations. Around 1310, an artist known as Giotto painted several major series of frescoes (mural painting done on wet plaster) in which we see the beginnings of a modern Western notion of composition, dramatic narrative, and the illusion of perspective. We will look at the refinements of these elements of art through the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when artists we now call avant-garde-notably Cézanne but also predecessors such as Courbet and Manet, and successors such as Picasso and Matisse-presented serious challenges to these fundamental elements of painting. We will look at the extraordinary art produced between the time of Giotto and Cézanne, as well as the consequences of the modernist challenge to art, including 20th-century abstract painting and conceptual art.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: ArtsInternational Cultures (IL)General Education: Arts (GA)GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies

869,ARTH 222Q,ARTH,222,Q,Intersections between Art History and the History of Psychology,"ART H 222Q: Intersections between Art History and Psychology Why is there a cultural association between mental illness and artistic creation? What is the history of this association? Is there a psychological foundation for it or is it a cultural stereotype with no basis in reality? To address these questions this course will explore the integrated histories of modern psychology and avant-garde art from the late 19th century to the present, comparing the different approaches to the topic in the disciplines of art history and psychology. We will discuss the possible benefits and drawbacks of each approach. By celebrating genius, art history has often been complicit in perpetuating the stereotype of the ""mad"" artist, even romanticizing it and discounting the reality of disease; whereas psychologists often view images as symptoms, misinterpreting the art historical context in which artists work. Interestingly, avant-garde art has often been associated with ""insanity"" with both negative and positive connotations. As a history of art and psychology course, the syllabus is organized as a chronological survey focusing on points of intersection between avant-garde art and psychology. Many of these points will be the lives and works of individual artists who either suffered mental illness, such as Vincent van Gogh, or engaged with psychology and mental illness as the subject of their art, as did Edvard Munch, the creator of the famous image, The Scream. In each case it is interesting to look at the reciprocity between the two disciplines: how the artists represented mental illness and transformed psychological theories into visual art and how psychologists and the medical establishment have responded to these artists, using them as diagnostic subjects. We will look specifically at bi-polar disorder and the psychological debates surrounding its relationship to artistic creativity. We will also look at larger avant-garde movements such as Expressionism and Surrealism, movements inspired by therapeutic practices, the art of mental patients, and psychoanalytic theory. We will look at the legacy of each of these movements in contemporary avant-garde art, including attitudes toward Outsider or Visionary artists and modern art therapy. Particular emphasis will be placed on psychoanalytic theory. Sigmund Freud's interest in art impacted his work and has rendered his writings conducive to artistic interpretation even today, although his theories have been rejected by many contemporary psychologists. We will look at artists who directly responded to Freud's writings such as Max Ernst and Salvador Dali, female surrealists such as Leonora Carrington, and issues surrounding ""hysteria"" as it was adopted by both male and female surrealists as a model for creative expression, and which continues to inform feminist art practices today. While contemporary avant-garde artists continue to respond to various psychological theories and practices, contemporary psychologists use formal analysis to understand the art of mental patients and employ artistic practices in the development of modern art therapy.",3,3,Prerequisites: ENGL 15

875,ARTH 292N,ARTH,292,N,Witches and Witchcraft from the Middle Ages to the Present,"This course will explore the social and cultural history of witches and witchcraft from the late Middle ages in Europe and the U.S. to the present. The very nature and broad scope of the topic lends itself to an interdisciplinary approach that combines history, folklore, religious studies, criminology, women's studies, art history, English literature and popular culture. Historically, real individuals were accused of witchcraft and suffered persecution and punishment accordingly. Others proclaimed themselves to be witches and the practice continues to attract adherents today such as in the modern Wiccan movement. However, modern consensus views witches as fictions: figures of magical power in folklore, literature, visual art and popular culture. From Shakespeare's Macbeth to the characters in the popular Harry Potter books and films, fictional witches have haunted European and American culture for centuries. This course will explore the complex interplay of fact and fiction in the history of witches and witchcraft. In other words, how do fictions become powerful enough to inform history? The course will also focus on the historical status of witches as a source of power outside of, and in opposition to, established political, religious and social structures. Since those accused of witchcraft were predominately women, how has witchcraft functioned as a means of empowerment for women as well as a tool for their persecution? And how has the representation of witches influenced attitudes towards women both historically and today? The course will begin with an historical inquiry into the belief in witchcraft during the late Middle Ages in Europe and the social and cultural role witches played in society. We will look at texts such as the Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of Witches) published in 1486 as a guide for hunting and destroying witches, as well as studies on the more constructive role witchcraft may have offered women and communities. The course will be organized chronologically and move back and forth between history, such as the Salem witch trials, and the representations of that history in art, literature and film. Particular emphasis will be placed on the visual arts, from the engravings of German Renaissance artists such as Albrecht Durer and Hans Baldung Grien, the gothic paintings of Francisco Goya during the Romantic period, to contemporary artist Louise Bourgeois' monument to those executed as witches in Norway. The course will end with analysis of images of witches in popular culture, movies and television, and with a discussion of the modern representations of the domesticated witch and the femme fatale.",3,3,Cross-listed with: HIST 292NInternational Cultures (IL)United States Cultures (US)General Education: Arts (GA)General Education: Humanities (GH)General Education -  Integrative: InterdomainGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason

Topics to be covered include Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art and other forms of art relying upon methods of appropriation, Minimalism, Conceptualism, Fluxus and Performance Art, Land Art and Site-Specificity, and Art in protest movements (such as the Civil Rights movement). The course will also address such larger issues as: 1) the means by which art works engage in critiques of racial, sexual and national identity; 2) the political uses to which contemporary art has been put (often by figures other than the artists); 3) the dominant critical paradigms through which art has been filtered; 4) the relationship of art works to commodity culture and late capitalism; 5) and the ways in which contemporary art works challenge notions of exhibition, patronage, and ownership of art. This course should be of interest to students of Art History as well as to students interested in post-war history, literature and intellectual culture. It should also be of use to those enrolled in studio art, architecture and other practicum areas.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: ArtsInternational Cultures (IL)United States Cultures (US)General Education: Arts (GA)GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking

ART H 426 Iconoclasm: Powerful Images and their Destruction (3) (US;IL) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.Images have been granted extraordinary powers in many human societies, and their purposeful destruction has been a recurrent feature of political, religious and social strife around the world. This course explores how and why humans have granted such power to images, and the subsequent reactions that have resulted in periodic outbreaks of iconoclasm. Topics include the historical specificity of image destruction, the role of art and its detractors in precipitating the Protestant Reformation, and the manipulation of iconoclasm in modern mass media. Victimized images covered may include the bronze bust of Sargon (3rd millennium BCE) and early Renaissance altarpieces through the statues of Saddam Hussein and beyond. We will read primary and secondary materials ranging from Biblical texts to letters to the editor in the New York Times. Through careful consideration of iconoclasms' historical contexts, we will explore art's ability to function as a societal lightning rod. This course has two major objectives: to introduce students to a subject matter that holds great relevance for our time, and to train them in the methods and ethics of scholarly research. This course fulfils elective and 400-level requirements in Art History and General Education (US and IL), but it is intended also to complement concentrations in History, Visual Studies, Religion, and Communications. It would be offered every two to three years.

We will look at new building types, the creation of civic institutions, and changes in the urban plan. The course will therefore provide an overview of the architecture and urbanism of the period and also explore the political and social contexts that made them possible. Topics include capitals of great political importance such as Paris, Beijing, and London as well as smaller centers like Turin and Lisbon that underwent major urban and architectural transformations. The social function of buildings that mark these capitals, from poor houses to opera houses, will also be explored. Primary and secondary reading, ranging from Pepy's Diary to Habermas' examination of the public sphere will offer period accounts as well as conceptual frameworks for understanding the capital. The objective is to challenge students to think deeply about our urban environment and its debts to this earlier era.

Over the course of a dynamic two centuries architects and patrons shaped, refined, and innovated upon distinctly French classical styles. Through an examination of some of the leading figures, such as François Mansart and Jules Hardouin-Mansart, Claude Perrault, Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, and Étienne-Louis Boullée, the course will introduce not only a wide range of key buildings, but also a distinct idea about the status of the architect in French society. Classes will also be devoted to specific themes, such as the role of academies in standardizing training, and the influence of public opinion on specific works. We will also examine the urban transformation of Paris into the capital of a centralized French state.    This course examines painting, sculpture, and architecture in France from the Wars of Religion through the French Revolution, from the close of the sixteenth century through the end of the eighteenth. In the seventeenth century with the art of Poussin, French painting can be seen to have come into its own, as Poussin broke with his contemporaries in establishing a particularly French mode of classicism in Rome. We see the efflorescence of classicism in history and landscape painting in the work of Poussin and Claude Lorrain, monumental realism in the work of the Le Nain brothers, and the development of complex allegories of power in the work of Peter Paul Rubens in France. We examine the Rococo style in terms of its eroticism, its artisanal ethic, and the new patterns of aristocratic patronage that emerge in the eighteenth century. We will also consider the rise of the public sphere and its impact on artists such as Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Jacques-Louis David, and David's pupils. With regard to sculpture, we will look at a range of styles from the baroque to the neoclassical.",3,3,Prerequisite: 3 credits in ART H

ART 476 / ARTH 476 History and Theory of Digital Art (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Approaches to Digital Art is a survey class that will offer the web designer, cyberspace architect, MUD traffic controller or enthusiastic surfer an opportunity to examine the humanistic aspects of contemporary digital art. Through readings and direct interaction with digital media and digital artists, the class will develop an appreciation of the ways in which the interface between human beings and technology has been historically constructed and is subject to critical investigation. The goal of the class is to prepare each student so that she or he may engage with digital media in a way that is every more historically and socially self aware.Students will address the ways in which digital technologies transform artistic practices such as museum display, the writing of art criticism, the definition of works of art, changing role of the artist and the changing space of the art studio. More important, however, by engaging with digital works of art students will learn to think critically about technology and its engagement with culture at large. They will be encouraged to think about the political, economic and social impact of digital technologies. This humanistic approach to technology would make this course particularly useful to students of art history, philosophy, comparative literature, art education, and the visual/plastic arts. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to the ways in which art on the internet and digital art in general challenge the integrity of categories such as race and national identity. For example, students will have an opportunity to engage with African American artists such as Keith Obadike, whose on-line performances include an attempt to put his ""blackness"" up for sale on ebay.com in August of 2001. Students may also look at the ways in which net.art (Art made to be viewed on the internet) can critique commercial cooptation of global culture: etoy.com, for example, is an international and collaborative artist's group that satirizes global capital by camouflaging itself as a multinational corporation.This class will depend largely upon written responses and class discussion, rather than upon tests. Thus, students will learn how to approach difficult theoretical sources that have been assigned to them, and they will learn how to ask the kinds of questions that will help them understand such sources. This course will emphasize critical thinking rather than memorization, so students will develop analytical skills that will be useful in many other contexts. Because students will be given weekly writing assignments, they will be able to improve their skills in composition.",3,3,Prerequisite:  ART H100 or ART H112 or ART H307 or ART H325 or ART H326 or ART  211

947,AA 121,AA,121,,Design Thinking and Creativity,"This course is an introductory, general education level course based on the premise that design is a fundamental human activity that everyone engages in one way or another. Design encompasses both the ability to imagine that which does not yet exist and to make it appear in concrete form. Design is a form of deliberate, considered action that seeks solutions to problems and creates useful and purposeful artifacts. Design is simultaneously used as a noun and a verb, and to describe a discipline and many fields of practice. Yet design remains essentially a black box to most people - its methods, processes, and components are mysterious, magical, and opaque. This course will turn the ""black box"" of design into a glass box. The course focuses on the relationship between ideas, tools, and artifacts in order to connect theory, practice, and outcomes. Using theory, practice, and artifacts from a range of design fields (including architecture, landscape architecture, product design, engineering, graphic design, environmental design, and design theory itself), the course will empower students to understand design from the perspective most useful to them and their work - ideas, application, and the things they encounter in the world. The course focuses on the kinds of problems, situations, and processes of thinking that are critical for designers, business professionals, engineers, humanists, social scientists and natural scientists. The course is divided into five distinct units, allowing a thematic and comparative analysis of a breadth of design topics: About Design; Design Thinking; The Elements of Design; Design as a Game; and, a Step-by-Step Guide to Design in Action. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand and analyze the role of design in the world and to take action themselves, including: * the breadth of design in the world * the power and responsibility of design * a range of design artifacts * how designers think and work * what creativity is and what it entails * understandings of design, design thinking, and creativity across a breadth of disciplines * the parts of design problems * how the design process can be described * strategies and methods applicable to the stages of the design process There are no prerequisites for this course. The course will serve as an introduction to fundamental ideas of design and complement design-focused courses in other departments/programs across the university.

ASIA 103 / RLST 103 Introduction to Hinduism (3) (GH;IL)(BA). This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. We begin with a discussion of the pre­-Vedic Indus Valley civilization reflecting upon its influence on later south Asian cultures. The course then traces how the Vedic ritual tradition, and the Vedantic philosophy gave rise to the concepts of Karma (individual action and its underlying motives), Samsara (the cyclical view of life), and the Atman (nature of the individual). Moreover, we pause here to explore the relationship between the emerging idea of civic responsibility (Dharma) and its relationship to the Vedic and Vedantic thought. Next we examine how the Vedantic philosophical tradition may have incorporated a diversity of philosophical views including both Brahmanical as well as non-­Brahmanical traditions of Buddhism, Jainism, Lokayata, etc. The class will read excerpts from the religious literature of the era. The first part of the course concludes with selected readings from the Bhagavadgita, Mahabharata, as well as some Buddhist and Jaina texts. All of these readings will be in English. Class discussions focus on how the classical Hindu worldview may have emerged from the philosophical foundation of the Vedantas, and later built the groundwork for the Hindu Bhakti (devotion) movements. The second part of the course focuses on the various regional Bhakti traditions from the middle ages onwards, analyzing how the regional cultures may have related with the great classical Brahmanic tradition. The course concludes with a discussion of how Hinduism in the post 1800s responded to the forces of colonization, exploring how the different religious and cultural traditions of south Asia may have interacted with other religious cultures (both indigenous and foreign) like Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, and Christianity. We shall read excerpts from noteworthy thinkers and writers of nineteenth and twentieth century to understand the very interesting dynamics between religion and civil society of more recent times.

1037,ASIA 480,ASIA,480,,Japan in the Age of Warriors,"An overview of Japan from the 10th to 17th century, a period of political decentralization, cultural efflorescence, and social change.  ASIA (HIST) 480 Japan in the Age of Warriors (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. By the eighth century, Japan had become a centralized state centered on the reign of a sovereign, commonly known in English as an emperor. At the end of the ninth century, the emperor&rsquo;s court relocated to the city of Heian (Kyoto), and soon thereafter, an elegant court culture developed in the capital. The courtly culture was based on civilian values and civilian rule. In the countryside, however, Japan was gradually becoming militarized. Local warlords began rising to prominence and vying with each other for power. One of them, Taira-no-Masakado, rebelled against the central government during the years 939-940, declaring himself &ldquo;emperor&rdquo; of several provinces in eastern Japan centered on Hitachi. Although the central government in Kyoto enlisted other warrior groups to put down Taira-no-Masakado&rsquo;s rebellion, the process of militarization was underway. Buddhist temples also participated in this process, using their wealth and influence to assemble monastic armies on occasion. This course examines Japanese history beginning approximately in the 10th century, at time when civilian high culture in the capital was approaching the height of its development. At the same time, the process of militarization of the countryside was beginning to undermine that civilian court culture. The course ends in approximately the seventeenth century with the establishment of a military government under the Tokugawa shoguns. This development was ostensibly the peak of warrior influence, with the samurai (=warrior) class entrenched by law as the elite group within society. However, just as the warriors began their rise to power in the tenth century, by the end of the seventeenth century they were rapidly losing influence and prestige to wealthy merchants as the forces of the market economy spread throughout Japanese society. HIST 480 is a course in medieval Japanese history, broadly defined. Different instructors will emphasize different aspects of Japanese history and culture during this era. Approaches to teaching will also vary depending on the instructor. Class sessions can take the form of lectures or discussions. Assessment methods and learning activities may include debates, discussions, exams, research papers, book review papers, and other similar academic activities.",3,3,Cross-listed with: HIST 480Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesInternational Cultures (IL)

And of course there are humans; that singularly unique species once described as the 'paragon of animals'. Whether the group is bacteria, worms, ants or humans selection has resulted in precise rules that govern interactions and maintain stability. Understanding these rules is the field of sociobiology and we can even see such rules at play among the inorganic realm as researchers select for social robots. In this course we explore sociobiology through stories of adaptation that will challenge you to pinpoint where and how selection is acting. We will deal with the well known topics of natural, sexual and artificial selection as well as less precisely understand topics of kin and group selection. Many of the stories in this course bring us to the exciting front line of research where acrimonious debates are waging. Because systems are often best understood when they are broken we will also tell stories of parasites and cheaters that destroy social cohesion. We will learn of such fascinating diseases as zombie ant fungi that manipulate ant behavior to the protozoans in your brain that affect your ability to drive. In societies the response to diseases is often collective and similar defenses can be seen across widely different groups so we will hear stories of how both social insects and humans have evolved adaptive architecture to reduce disease spread. We will also ask where we humans are going? To address this question the course will focus on our past and our many inventions from agriculture to cities. We will ask how our adaptations parallel those of other organisms and how they diverge.

C E 479 Environmental Microbiology for Engineers (3) C E 479 Environmental Microbiology for Engineers is a senior/graduate-level course comprised of three main sections: (1) the fundamentals of microbial structure, function, nutrition, and growth for students with no prior formal instruction in microbiology; (2) microbial diversity and ecology; and (3) the application of these fundamental microbial principles to environmental systems. In the fundamentals section, the course covers microbial nomenclature, macromolecules, cell biology, energetics, growth, and genetic regulation. This is illustrated with calculations of thermodynamic constraints in microbially catalyzed reactions, the calculation of efficiencies based on energy conservation from common pathways, and the connection of these efficiencies to microbial growth in a chemostat. Building on these fundamental concepts of metabolic potential and conserving energy and acquiring reducing equivalents from redox reactions, the second section covers the reactions and energetics of the primary microbial functional diversity such as phototrophy, lithotrophy, autotrophy, anaerobic respirations, and fermentations. It also introduces modern molecular biology techniques for studying microbial systems, and pulls the concepts of functional diversity together by illustration with the major nutrient cycles, including discussions of environments in which each reaction might be encountered. Finally, the last section applies these ecological principles to several specific engineered environments of interest. Homework assignments throughout the semester involve questions about the methods, findings, or applications of recent articles that highlight the recently covered material, giving the students experience in the critical evaluation of primary literature and demonstrating the relevance of the material to environmental microbiology research and application. Complementing the progression of the lectures are eight instructional laboratories that provide hands-on application of diagnostic microbiological techniques to the characterization of environmental enrichment cultures and pure cultures. For example, a microscopy lab immediately follows the lecture material on cell biology, an enrichment experiment follows the material on nutrition, an enumeration experiment follows the section on microbial growth, etc. The final seven weeks of the laboratory period are devoted to group projects, in which students apply the techniques the have learned as appropriate to answer specific short-term research hypotheses. The final period is devoted to group presentations of their projects.",3,3,"Prerequisite:  CHEM 111 , C E  370"

1730,CAMS 4,CAMS,4,,Jewish and Christian Foundations,"This course seeks to help students better understand the Bible and appreciate its role as an authoritative collection of sacred texts for Jews and Christians. The Bible is a difficult book, one that is demanding on many levels. In order to read the Bible intelligently, it is important to understand the historical and cultural backgrounds of the biblical writings. This course explores the history and geography of ancient Near Eastern civilizations that shaped the experience of ancient Israel and, later, the Greek and Roman imperial contexts that shaped Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity. The focus of the course, however, is on the biblical narrative itself and the particular ways that the story of Israel and its covenant with God was represented in scripture: in tales, poems, hymns, dialogues, and genealogies. A basic goal of the course, then, is to promote intelligent, well-informed reading of the Bible. Also important is the willingness to read the Bible closely and critically, with a view toward larger questions raised by biblical texts: how is God to be known and understood? What is the purpose of human life in the world? What moral obligations ought to structure our common life? Does human history have direction and purpose? What is the good and how do we follow it? The Bible takes up these questions and many more. Though an ancient anthology shaped by the succession of Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman empires, the Bible is not merely a product of its original contexts. Millennia of transmission and interpretation have made it a product of history in a much more extended and dynamic sense. In this course, we will examine larger questions raised by the biblical writers and consider the ways that the Bible has shaped, informed, and guided Jewish and Christian ways of life.",3,3,"Cross-listed with: JST 4, RLST 4Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesBachelor of Arts: Other CulturesInternational Cultures (IL)United States Cultures (US)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies"

CMLIT 113 / JST 113 / CAMS 113 / RLST 113 Myths and Legends of the Jews (3) (GH;IL) The impact of the Bible on Western Culture is immense. Beyond its religious importance, the motifs and images from its myths and stories permeate literature and art, providing a basic frame of reference that for much of history could be taken for granted. A degree of familiarity with these motifs so as to be truly fluent is no longer common, and so it requires special effort to discern allusions to biblical traditions. Moreover, these traditions are not static: religious communities continually re-interpret them and appropriate them in very different contexts. Many prominent traditions in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam do not appear explicitly anywhere in the Hebrew Bible, but are the product of imaginative and ingenious interpretation and re-tellings. Why, for example, is Noah an example of a righteous person in Christian tradition, but in rabbinic tradition is more often portrayed as a profane, earthly-minded man who was saved only because he was the least bad of an evil generation? Why is Moses commonly portrayed with horns in medieval art? Underlying such different traditions are centuries of debate and reflection on these texts as sacred scripture, and competing religious communities often authorized their distinctive beliefs and practices by reading them into scripture. The differences are often too subtle to discern apart from careful comparison. This course will explore the boundaries between Scripture and tradition by means of a close examination of the myths and stories in the Hebrew Bible and their subsequent interpretation and re-tellings in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Using methods from comparative mythology and folklore, as well as comparative midrash, our procedure will be to compare these traditions closely with the biblical text, asking: What are the main motifs in the mythology of Judaism? Does Judaism have a coherent mythology? How do their myths compare with the myths of their neighbors? Where did these myths come from? How do these traditions relate to the Bible? What was the function of these myths? Why are there competing myths? How is it possible that Judaism affirms belief in only one God, but has myths that include other divine beings? We will also compare with later interpretive traditions (Jewish, Christian, Islamic). Can we trace trajectories of interpretation? Can we discern particular interpretive methods in operation? We will seek to answer: what do these re-workings of the traditions tell us about the development and function of Scripture, and the social circumstances of the communities? Finally, we will seek to detect reflections of these interpretive traditions in literature and art from the medieval to the modern periods. The course is organized around major topics in the Jewish Scriptures: God, creation, heaven and hell, Torah, Sabbath, Abraham and other ancestors, Israel and holy land, exile, and Messiah. Throughout we will consider how sacred stories function to form ethical perspectives and values.",3,3,"Cross-listed with: CMLIT 113, JST 113, RLST 113Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesBachelor of Arts: Other CulturesInternational Cultures (IL)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key LiteraciesGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason"
1760,CAMS 121,CAMS,121,,Jesus the Jew,"Although Jesus of Nazareth is the object of Christian devotion, he was not a Christian himself, but a pious Jew. What can be known about the historical figure of Jesus the Palestinian Jew? How would his teachings and actions have fit in the context of Judaism of his day, in the Greco-Roman world? What did he mean when he proclaimed the coming kingdom of God? Because almost all of our source material espouses Jesus as the Christ of Christian faith, the first step is to understand the aims and perspectives of these Christian sources, including the canonical Gospels as well as non-canonical Gospels. Through careful examination of these sources in light of critical scholarship and the social and historical context of Judaism in the Greco-Roman world, we will consider how much the historian is able to reconstruct of Jesus using historical method, what the limits of this investigation are, and how relevant the task is. We will consider and evaluate a few of the different scholarly reconstructions of the historical Jesus. Major emphases will include the historical, social, religious, political, and cultural contexts of Jesus, including important precursors; the political, institutional, and cultural history of the teachings and actions of Jesus in their Jewish setting, and how these are reinterpreted by his followers after his death. Attention will be paid to the development of variant Christian traditions about Jesus including Jesus as Messiah, his death as a saving event, the resurrection as exaltation of Jesus as Lord, the memorialization of Jesus in Christian ritual practice, and the cultural and religious impact of Jesus throughout history. In addition to the early Christian sources on Jesus (especially the canonical Gospels, but also other New Testament texts and non-canonical writings), on each topic students will read selections from early Jewish writings in order to illuminate the cultural context. These include the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Jewish texts among the so-called Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, early rabbinic texts, and epigraphical writings.

1763,CAMS 124,CAMS,124,,Early and Medieval Christianity,"This course provides an introduction to the history of Christianity. It traces, specifically, the development of the Christian movement from its beginnings as a small Jewish sect in Jerusalem to its unlikely emergence as the religion of the Roman Empire and, finally, its subsequent spread and development in Europe, Asia, and Africa. In form and structure, the course is historical, following figures and events in a more or less chronological sequence and taking up questions of causality, influence, and social identity. Yet the course is also concerned with the ideas, concepts, and philosophical viewpoints that have shaped Christianity and given it a certain intellectual coherence over time. The course begins with first-century construals of messianic identity and also with the figure of Jesus, as he was portrayed in the New Testament gospels. It then follows the first generations of the Christian movement, considering it within the context of first-century Judaism and the early Roman empire. Topics include persecution, martyrdom, and the important contributions of Origen. The middle section of the course looks at the second, third, and fourth centuries through three lenses, as it were: the office of bishop, the rise of monasticism, and the realities of empire. Bishops, monks, and emperors all shaped Christianity in essential ways, creating a rich and complicated spiritual, moral, theological, intellectual, and geo-political legacy for generations to come. The final third of the course looks at the development of Christianity beyond the fourth century in geographical groupings including churches in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, western Europe, Byzantium, and the Slavic lands. It is hoped, in all of this, that students will gain an understanding not only of Christian history but also of what made - and what makes - Christianity a distinctive and influential religion.",3,3,"Cross-listed with: JST 124, RLST 124Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesInternational Cultures (IL)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies"

1772,CAMS 180,CAMS,180,,Ancient Warfare,"Historical survey of the evolution of warfare in the ancient Mediterranean region from prehistoric times to the Later Roman Empire. CAMS 180 CAMS (HIST) 180 Ancient Warfare (3) (GH;IL) Warfare has occupied a central place in the civilizations of the Mediterranean from the earliest times. The prehistoric origins of warfare is a hotly debated topic and constitutes the starting point for this course. Most scholars are agreed that military culture grew in step with sociopolitical development over the course of the third millennium BCE. In the following centuries, the Egyptians, and later the Assyrians and Persians, took great strides in developing sophisticated tactical systems, using infantry, chariotry, and cavalry. These matters occupy a little over the first third of the course. Across the Aegean Sea, Bronze Age (Mycenaean) Greece was ruled by elites occupying massively walled citadels, their leaders buried surrounded by their weapons. But how did these warriors fight? Do the epic poems of Homer memorialize Bronze Age combat? In the Archaic Period (700-500 BCE) infantry warfare in Greece was transformed by the appearance of the heavily-armored infantryman (the hoplite), deployed in a tight formation (the phalanx). The processes involved in the appearance of this kind of warfare, its nature, and its affects on Greek society and culture will be the focus of our attention for the second third of the course. On the periphery of the Mediterranean basin stood a variety of warrior cultures (the Scythians, Celts, or Germans). Numerous warrior-dominated polities vied with each other in Archaic Italy, but one of them, sitting on a ford of the river Tiber, ultimately rose to be the greatest military power produced by the ancient Mediterranean world: Rome. The Roman legions first won and then ensured the security of a Mediterranean-wide empire that stood for 700 years and evolved ultimately into world's first standing army of professional volunteers. The Roman military system holds our attention for the final third of the course. The course defines warfare broadly to include both tactical and strategic, as well as cultural and ideological, matters. Even this canvas is too vast to be surveyed in all its richness, so the major themes explored are: (i) what is war, where does it come from, and how did it change as civilization spread?; (ii) in what ways did warfare develop in the periods under study, in terms of strategy, tactics, and weapons technology?; (iii) how do different warfare practices reflect essential facets of the various cultures under consideration?",3,3,Cross-listed with: HIST 180Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesInternational Cultures (IL)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning

In addition, we will consider how eroticism and gender both support and subvert political and social ideologies. The objective of this course is to enable students to analyze gender identities and conventions surrounding sexuality in the context of the Greek and Roman worlds. This course will also invite students to consider the influence of ancient conceptions of gender and sexuality on modern discussions and debates. Authors and texts may include Homer, Hesiod, Sappho, Sophocles, Aristophanes, Plato, Aristotle, the Hippocratic corpus, Catullus, Virgil, Ovid, and Augustine. These ancient readings will be supplemented with selections from modern feminist theorists and gender studies.",3,3,Prerequisite:  3 credits in CAMS

Akkadian is the cover term for the East Semitic dialects spoken and written in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) from the mid-third millennium b.c.e. to about the first century c.e. These dialects (Babylonian and Assyria) are all quite similar. As is customary, the course will focus on Old Babylonian, as this is the 'classical' variety of the language, and served as the basis for the dialect of the vast majority of later Akkadian texts (Standard Babylonian). This course aims to familiarize students with the basics of Akkadian grammar and enable them to read a wide variety of genres: legal texts, letters, omens, royal inscriptions, and literary compositions. Because of the specific nature of the writing system and the fact that many texts are available only in copies, students will also be introduced to the cuneiform script, its basic structure, and a basic repertoire of signs. Every meeting will follow a similar structure: the first part will be devoted to the exercises corresponding to the lesson in the textbook that was explained the previous day; and the second part will be an explanation of the next lesson, the exercises of which will have to be prepared for the next meeting. Students will be required to do all the assigned exercises in advance, and participate in class. Special emphasis will be put on class participation: every student will be asked to read and translate in class. Furthermore, occasional quizzes are by no means a remote possibility. In addition, there will be a mid-term and a final examination. This course complements other existing courses in areas such as Ancient Near Eastern studies, biblical studies.

It is designed to introduce students to principles of effective public speaking, implemented through the design and presentation of individual speeches. Class size is limited to ensure that scheduled meetings can support students in focusing on the development of public speaking skills through in-class activities, collaborative learning, peer critiques, and examinations of various communication practices.  Drawing upon concepts from the study of both rhetoric and communication science, the course aims to foster habits of ethical self-reflection alongside practical speaking skills. To that end, course content centers on the diverse ways that students participate in practices of citizenship and civic engagement. Linking content to practice, students are expected to demonstrate course concepts through the situational, generic, and ethical choices they make in composing their major speech assignments.  At least three individual graded speeches are required in this course. Additional presentations (graded or non-graded) may be required by some instructors. Following major speeches, students may compose reflective essays engaging in the critique and assessment of their own and others' work. Assessment may include evaluation by a combination of exams (although no final exam is given in the course) and/or occasional quizzes and other activities, all of which emphasize the mastery and application of the conceptual content of the course. Presentations are evaluated for content, organization, and presentation.  Numerous sections of CAS 100A are offered throughout the university system in any given semester.

The course not only provides a survey of essential methods of rhetorical criticism, but also requires students to produce works of rhetorical criticism themselves based on substantive research and written evaluation of a rhetorical artifact. Methods of rhetorical criticism are distinct from analytic methods used by other academic disciplines. Scholars of communication began to establish methods of rhetorical criticism in the early twentieth century in an effort to distinguish the aims of their scholarly pursuits from those of literary criticism or historical research. Rhetorical criticism evaluates the rhetoric of public communication (speeches, debates, or mediated messages intended to shape public understanding of real-world social, political, or moral issues). Such methods enable rhetorical critics to do so, moreover, not only by examining who said what at a given moment in history, but by closely analyzing how and why strategic uses of language or symbolic communication influenced public beliefs or behaviors.

This course argues that war is indeed an art, and a thoroughly rhetorical one in which the political economy of persuasion is as important as high-tech weaponry and whiz-bang battle plans. By considering some of war's most thoughtful theorists, by discussing wars past and present, and by reading powerful defenses and trenchant critiques of war, this course will help students understand how wars are managed rhetorically. This course satisfies a grave need: for living in the post-9/11 world requires the critical rhetorical skills necessary to understand not just how war is waged or how it structures our lives but how war is advocated and defended.

1943,COMM 150N,COMM,150,N,The Art of the Cinema,"COMM 150 (The Art of Cinema): COMM 150 is an introduction to cinema studies which aims to provide students with media literacy for a world in which communication is increasingly visual and cinematic in its form. The course assumes that films tell stories and make arguments as communicative forms by drawing on a visual language that can be learned. As such, films can be interpreted and analyzed to reveal something about the cultural conditions that produced them. The course seeks to familiarize students with examples of films that speak to both the forms that they follow and the cultural context in which they were produced. Movies, from early silent films to contemporary blockbusters, are examined as formal constructs, market commodities, and cultural artifacts that aim to represent a world for the viewer. Topics include the emergence of the cinema as a communications technology, business industry and cultural institution; the global dominance of classical Hollywood cinema; American film industry organization (production, distribution, exhibition, vertical integration, the studio system, the star system); analysis of film styles (national cinemas, historical movements); analysis of film genres (e.g., silent film melodrama, film noir, comedy, the war film, the western); consideration of film audiences (reception, spectatorship, criticism); introduction to film aesthetics (film art and appreciation); and alternative cinemas (independent, documentary and experimental cinemas). COMM 150 emphasizes media literacy and seeks to help students develop critical thinking, reading and viewing skills while providing them with a historical context for the media that they consume on a regular basis. All sections integrate lectures and readings with viewing feature films during the weekly practicum period. Many sections also incorporate slides and film or video clips during the lecture periods to allow students to exercise their critical viewing skills regarding certain teaching points. Students prepare for film screenings by reading, listening to lectures, and analyzing examples of relevant works. Introductory lectures seek to provide a critical and historical context for each week's screening; follow-up lectures offer critical analysis and examinations reward close viewing.

We will discuss the large-scale technological systems such as telephone, cable, wireless and computer networks over which media and telecommunications services are delivered today. We will not be discussing the content offered over telecommunications networks as much as the infrastructures themselves: the conduits over which information is delivered to the home and the workplace.With technological convergence and regulatory changes, telephone, cable and wireless networks have acquired the capability to provide services earlier reserved exclusively for one or the other network. For example, we can now access telephone services over wireless networks or over the Internet. Similarly, Web content is available with the traditional telephone modem, as well as over cable, wireless and even satellite networks. In the not too distant future, it may become more meaningful to talk in terms of consumer network to a broadband conduit for all types of content, rather than to particular services such as cable television or long-distance telephony.It thus becomes necessary for those who wish to participate in the telecommunications industry of the future to have a clear understanding of the way large-scale telecommunications infrastructures are put together and operated. Existing courses in the telecommunications curriculum provide instruction in the technology and content aspects of the media and telecommunications industries. The proposed course will complement these existing courses by focusing on the economic, regulatory and business aspects of large-scale networks, in a historical and policy context.What are the mechanisms by which large-scale telecommunications systems such as telephone, cable, wireless and computer networks are deployed over time? What are the costs involved in the initial deployment and expansion, and how do they influence policy? How do planners evaluate and choose between alternative technologies of delivering services? What are the economic justifications for and against government regulation of networked technologies? How do companies charge for services provided over networked systems? What problems do we face as more and more services--such as real-time gaming and interactive television--are added to telecommunications networks, and what are some of the current proposals to solve these problems? These are some of the questions that will be discussed in class.",3,3,Enforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: COMM 180 and COMM 380 or permission of the program.

Five structural concepts or key themes - local knowledge, relational knowledge, empirical knowledge, spiritual knowledge, and traditional knowledge - provide a conceptual framework for understanding indigenous cultures and knowledge production and their unique contributions to western society in the 21st century. Students will be introduced to the Algonquian cultures of the Great Lakes Region and to the Ojibwe (Anishinaabeg), Odawa, and Potawatomi (Three Fires) cultures in particular. This course will introduce students to the distinctive ways indigenous people experience, understand, and know the world through their relationship with the land or region to which they belong. Too often, colonizers around the world have ignored indigenous knowledge systems even though these ways of knowing have sustained peoples, cultures, and environments for thousands of generations. Because these ways of knowing are generally preserved and transmitted through stories, music, ceremony, and embodied traditions, they are seldom understood and frequently dismissed by those who control the production of knowledge in the modern world. The knowledge of the indigenous peoples of the Great Lakes region will, in this course, be presented as an empirically grounded scientific body of knowledge and theory comparable and complementary to the European tradition and, in specific ways, enhancing the sustainability of western scientific knowledge and practice.

As community development (CD) scholars and practitioners, we are in a position to integrate these questions-and a vision of just sustainability-into our work. Central to this task is working in partnership with community members to identify problems, to ask questions, and to develop solutions.

CMLIT 120 The Literature of the Occult (3) (GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. CMLIT 120 is the study of literatures of the occult. Through readings of creative and critical works, you will develop an enhanced awareness of the variations among cultures and historical periods in accepting, fostering, tolerating or sometimes suppressing-unorthodox traditions. Our range of readings from world literature will show that what is rejected or scorned in one cultural context may be tolerated or even honored in another. You will also explore the social, political, ethical and religious implications of ""occult."" The course will be designed to compare various manifestations of the occult in literatures from around the globe and throughout history. You will explore issues of difference, and will develop an awareness of the tendency to demonize the 'strange' and 'inaccessible.' Through various texts from around the world, you will develop the ability to analyze literature in different ways. Readings will be examined both within their cultural context, and in relation to widely found or perhaps universal themes of the occult which transcend the boundaries of time and place. CMLIT 120 is one of the many choices of survey courses which count towards the Comparative Literature major and the World Literature minor.

CMLIT 130 Banned Books: International and Comparative Perspectives (3) (GH;IL)This course examines one of the most documented events in the history of book reception - the banning of books. Bannings provide a useful window onto the myriad functions of culture in social identity formation. In order to understand how and why offense is given and taken, students will learn to place texts in a specific context of their historical production and reception and also to extrapolate connections between disparate moments when taboos were named. Incorporating examples from a range of global systems of censorship, the course examines differences in the modes and effects of repression and the sometimes surprising connections between church and monarchy, fascism and democracy. This course raises the following questions:-How has censorship been justified? When, if ever, is censorship justifiable? What are the grounds on which censorship can be judged successful or incomplete? Who censors? Who is censored? What are local categories of censorship? Though books are banned for reasons of blasphemy, sedition, and obscenity in various guises in several cultures, are these global categories? How do writers write against a ban? How do they write within it? What are the roles of importation, technologies of circulation, and geography in the censorship of texts? How do border-crossings and forms of miscegenation offend? Is there a unifying aesthetics to books that offend? The course will help students understand value systems and historical contexts in which they were produced and in which they caused offense. It will also ask students to draw connections between seemingly unrelated moments of offense in order to assist students in developing both analytical and expressive abilities. The course is designed to be suitable for all students, whether or not they have previously studied literature or comparative literature.",3,3,International Cultures (IL)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies

2225,CMLIT 183Q,CMLIT,183,Q,From Beast Books to Resurrecting Dinosaurs,"In this honors course, we'll explore changing perspectives on life and approaches to studying life. More specifically, we'll examine, through an historical lens, humankind's quest to describe and explain and, ultimately, to expand the diversity of the living world. We begin with early attempts to classify living things for example, Aristotle and Pliny. We then see how medieval bestiaries appropriated classical ideas about nature while adding to them in the context of Christian historia. In the Enlightenment, Linnaeus's taxonomic work provided a new way of naming and systematizing organisms. On the other hand, the nascent scientific methods of Sir Francis Bacon anticipate the shift from the descriptive to the theoretical and mechanistic that accompanied Darwin's first sketch of a phylogenetic tree and the theory of evolution. We consider new theories, methods, and language in our examination of Watson and Crick and the double helix, molecular biology, and genomics. The course concludes with a glimpse at future possibilities enabled by what was studied previously in the course: genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and de-extinction. The course's original structure offers the experiential engagement of the sciences through laboratory experiments and fieldwork along with the workshop and directed discussions characteristic of the humanities seminar. The content and type of ""readings"" also reflect both areas and include primary and secondary sources in a variety of media. A visit to a natural history museum and/or zoo provides important physical contexts where students learn about type specimens, live specimens, and how scientists today use collections. They will assemble and curate their own zoological collection, juxtaposing various approaches to describing and classifying animals. The integration of the humanities and the sciences into a single course, along with the incorporation of significant experiential work, helps students gain a broad and deep understanding of and appreciation for each of these intellectual disciplines and for life itself.",3,3,Cross-listed with: SC 183QGeneral Education: Humanities (GH)General Education:  Natural Sciences (GN)General Education -  Integrative: InterdomainHonorsGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies

The course has broad applicability not only to students of literature and students of the cinema, but to all students who need to understand ways to compare relationships between disparate communications and artistic media. Students begin by understanding techniques and theories of both cinematic and literary analysis. Then, they explore theories of adaptation between media, including general theories of artistic and cultural influence. Among the media students may encounter in addition to literary fiction and narrative cinema are the graphic novel, creative nonfiction, drama, poetry, journalism, video games, the documentary cinema, and the experimental cinema. Students work through case studies of adaptation in literal terms, such as the transformation of graphic novels into narrative cinema. Students also work through case studies in influence, in which distinct art and media discourses affect one another, as in the relationship between videogames and the cinema. Students study transmedia storytelling, in which core narratives are expressed in different media. Students also study transcultural and transnational storytelling, in which adaptation and influence are conducted across borders. Students study questions of representation, particularly of difference (race, class, sexuality/gender) and cultural specificity. Students learn the historical and institutional settings which have conditioned these intermediations. The economics of literary and media production and the circumstances of reception of distinct media are explored. Students will experience classical and non-classical forms of storytelling, as well as fictional and non-fictional discourses. In this course, students will meet ancillary concerns in adaptation, such as translation, dramaturgy, and genre scholarship. Students express their individual conclusions in summary projects which apply theory to particular instances of adaptation and influence between media. These projects may include creative work, and multimedia texts which enact as well as analyze adaptation. As advanced scholars in the disciplines of literary and cinematic studies, students are expected to synthesize previous learning in these fields in their summary projects.",3,3,Enforced Prerequisite at Enrollment:  COMM 150 or ENGL 15 or ENGL 30H or ENGL 137H or CAS 137H

CMPEN 454CMPEN 454 Fundamentals of Computer Vision (3)CMPEN 454 is an introduction to computer vision. The goal of computer vision is to make computers understand and interpret visual information. Computer vision systems bring together imaging devices, computers, and sophisticated algorithms for solving problems in areas such as industrial inspection, medicine, document analysis, autonomous navigation, and remote sensing. The course involves both pedagogical written assignments and computer projects.The beginning of the course gives an overview of computer vision and introduces low level image analysis techniques for binary images. Binary vision systems are useful when the silhouette of imaged objects convey enough information to recognize them. Examples can be found in optical character recognition, chromosome analysis and recognition of industrial parts. Moreover, many techniques developed for binary systems can be applied to gray level or color images. Next, the course covers image segmentation and contours. These topics are the foundation of most computer vision techniques. For an image to be correctly interpreted, it must be partitioned into regions that correspond to distinct objects or parts of objects. First, region based techniques such as thresholding, split and merge, region growing and texture analysis are introduced. Next, edge based techniques using gradient and Laplacian operators are discussed. Finally, contour representations and curve approximations linking edges into region boundaries are studied.Next, depth from vision, with emphasis in stereo vision, is considered. Calculating distances to and among various points in the scene is important in many computer vision tasks such as inspection, robot manipulation, and autonomous navigation. In this part of the course the geometry of stereo systems and how to obtain depth maps from stereo image pairs is studied. Also, alternative 3D imaging sensors such as laser based range finders and radars are discussed.Following stereo, the topic of computer vision is broaden to understand sequences of images over time. In this section techniques using information on spatial and temporal changes are used to design computer vision systems capable of coping with moving and changing objects, changing illumination and changing viewpoints. Visual motion is important primarily for two reasons. First, motion is a very important cue to understand the scene structure. Second, biological systems do use motion to infer properties of the surrounding world with very little a priori knowledge.Finally, the topic of 3D object recognition is discussed. Object recognition entails two main issues: object identification and object localization. Identification determines the objects being imaged while localization determines their position in the world and with respect to the sensors. This topic builds upon all the different techniques discussed until this point.",3,3,Prerequisite:  MATH 230 or MATH 231 ; CMPSC121 or CMPSC201

The course design alerts students to many of the limitations of the various strategies and techniques of scientific criminal investigation, equipping, them to judge the validity of various findings and to assess the qualifications, and methods employed by different experts. The course gives special attention to strategies and tactics of interrogation and to means of' corroborating interrogation data with scientific data obtained from other investigative techniques. The course provides an introduction to various techniques of' fingerprinting, including ink pads and dusting techniques, as well as several techniques for bringing out latent fingerprints, with an emphasis on the careful collection and preservation of this evidence. It will introduce methods of drug testing, including techniques for insuring the validity of specimens and basic chemical analysis kits currently available for drug testing, with an emphasis on the careful collection and preservation of this evidence. It demonstrates and provides practical experience in breathalyzer utilization, as well as other investigative techniques for assessing driver impairment resulting from excess alcohol intake. It provides a basic introduction to DNA technology to the point of equipping students with a fundamental understanding of DNA evidence, including probabilities associated with various findings. Throughout the course, there is special stress on the concept of crime scene investigation, including strategies for cordoning off crime scenes and restricting contamination of evidence, basic crime scene mapping, and analysis of evidence such as blood splattering, foreign objects, unusual markings, hair and fiber samples, and other aspects of evidence. Finally, the course stresses preparation of investigative reports, with an emphasis upon clarity of presentation, attention to relevant details, preparation for presentation of evidence in court, and careful and concise writing.

CRIM (CRIMJ) 432 Crime and the American Court System (3) CRIM/CRIMJ 432, Crime and The American Court system, studies the courts from the lower courts to the Supreme Court and the various actors that play important roles in the functioning of the courts. First, the course studies the jurisdictions of the various courts and their organization in various state systems as well as the federal courts as well as the organization of state and federal administrative offices that manage the courts including the training of judges and the preparation of the court budget. Subsequent to the development of the basic understanding of the court jurisdiction and organization, the class studies the roles of the key actors in the day-in and day-out operation of the courts. In the spotlight are judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys although the role of the probation officers and clerk of courts are also intertwined with the processing of defendants. Of particular importance in this component of the course is the development of what is referred to as the court community and the focal concerns and goals that the court must consider as it processes cases. An, understanding of court community and focal concerns serves as crucial context for understanding the role of public policy as it attempts to shift or change the decision making of the court. One important dynamic of this course is the understanding that the court, although functioning as an institution to provide a neutral field on which accusations of criminality are to be played out, operates similarly to other organizations in that they are to be efficient (move cases with minimum overhead) and to be effective (provide justice, and protect the public). How the courts balance these competing demands and the informal processes that emerge in the processing of defendants is the key focus of the class. Finally, the course explores the attempts to reform the courts from the sentencing reforms such as determinate sentencing, mandatory minimums including '3 strikes' and sentencing guidelines. These issues highlight the political context of the courts and adaptability of the courts to attempts to change their values, and decisions.

2519,CRIM 201,CRIM,201,,Presumed Innocent? Social Science of Wrongful Conviction,"The criminal justice system is a human creation and some errors are expected. Sometimes guilty parties go free and sometimes innocent people are convicted. In this course, we will employ the perspective of the social scientist to understand why and how wrongful convictions occur. How can social science help to predict, explain, and prevent wrongful convictions? This course is organized into three units. In the first unit, we will examine the large body of social science research that demonstrates disparities in all stages of the criminal justice system. For example, young Black and Latino men are disproportionately arrested, charged, convicted and imprisoned for violent crimes. This is partly due to these men disproportionately living in environments that foster crime, but social science research shows sometimes it's also partly due to the discretionary decisions of police, prosecutors, and courts. As a result, these demographic groups are most likely to be wrongfully convicted. In the second unit, we'll explore the factors in the justice system that might lead to a wrongful conviction, including false confessions, eyewitness misidentification, poor legal representation, government misconduct, and informants and snitches. Social scientific findings elucidate how each of these factors influence conviction accuracy. Finally, we'll discuss how social science research on the risks and factors that contribute to wrongful convictions can be used to improve policies to reduce the risk of such convictions. Simple reforms such as openness about plea-bargaining, eyewitness identification reform (e.g., sequential lineups, double-blind procedures, etc.), recording of interrogations, and introducing Innocence Commissions in every state can improve our criminal justice system.",3,3,Cross-listed with: SOC 201General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)GenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Key LiteraciesGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason

As students have not yet been exposed to methods of instructional planning and delivery, their tutoring of individuals and small groups will be carried out under the direct supervision of a professional teacher.Through their observation and participation in these educational settings, students will develop an awareness of observation as a tool for understanding and analyzing educational environments, teaching and learning. They will develop an understanding of the nature of participant observation as well as a variety of frameworks and strategies that can be used for observation as well as the skills necessary to communicate observations professionally and ethically. Engaging in extended observations in educational settings provides students with an opportunity to enrich and deepen their understanding of a variety of educational concepts that they will encounter in prerequisite or concurrent courses including child development, English language learning and development, principles of human learning, individual differences in human ability including special needs students, cultural diversity, and contemporary issues in education and their impact on childhood educational settings.Finally, CI 295A will provide an opportunity for students to examine childhood education as a future career. They will be introduced to notions of teaching in general as a career as well as to specialized aspects of teaching in both pre-kindergarten and elementary school settings. Students will examine their own biographies as learners and the implications of their biographies for the development of a teacher identity and the potential suitability of childhood education as a career. Students will also be engaged in examining a variety of codes for professional and ethical conduct for educators.

Educational environments can pose challenges to students in recovery, and without proper support, students often return to active use of alcohol and other substances, which often invites disastrous life consequences, including educational failure. With the proper supports in place, students often thrive across multiple domains. Recovery High Schools provide access to social systems, coping mechanisms, recreational activities, and pro-recovery peer groups. Collegiate Recovery Programs are expanding rapidly: they are typically low-cost, featuring s small staff, a space on campus in which to meet, a peer-support community, and recovery-protective programming. A growing body of evidence suggests that these programs have very low relapse rates, low attrition, and higher GPAs than their host institutions. The course builds awareness of terminology, especially in relation to stigma-reduction and recovery messaging. It explores various theoretical contexts, including ecological theory and resiliency theory. It explores new paradigms in the management of chronic health conditions, through Recovery-oriented Systems of Care (ROSC) and the expansion of the continuum of care that colleges and universities offer their students to include ongoing support for recovery. Since participation in 12-step recovery programs is very high in RHSs and CRPs, we explore the known mechanisms of 12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. Building on these insights, the role of narrative in making ""storied"" identity changes is also explored. The course also examines the way in which educational and recovery curricula complement one another to bring about lasting personal transformations. Students will apply their understandings in the course by completing a final project in which they demonstrate various ways that the course content might inform the work of practitioners who work with students in recovery in healthcare, education, and beyond. This course is especially suited for students intending to work in schools and other education-related settings, including Recovery High Schools and Collegiate Recovery Programs.",3,3,

EM SC 101 Resource Wars (3) (US;IL) The faculty of the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences are uniquely qualified to teach ""Resource Wars"", a course that presents an analysis of natural resources and how competition for them shapes contemporary and historical culture and geopolitics. ""Resource wars"" will examine the extent to which the Gulf War of 1991, the explosive conflict between the United States and Islamic extremists, and present engagement in Iraq are manifestations of a foreign policy that comes from a desire for resource security. While the current Iraq war is the most recent manifestation of the clash between US and IL cultures, there are many examples of past resource wars in world history. Although the present conflict in the Middle East is about petroleum, past conflicts involve the entire spectrum of natural resources from gold and diamonds to rubber and tea to water, clean air, and living space. Class discussion will meld the technical aspects of discovery and extraction with its impact on society from a cultural and geopolitical points of view (US & IL).Technical analysis starts with the geology of the natural resource. The extraction, harnessing, or mining of that natural resource and resource transportation come next. The use of that natural resource as a material follows. Of course, short term and long climatic instability may play roles. The human elements (US & IL) involved in the trading and development of the resource lead to both armed interstate conflicts and intrastate disputes. Cultural questions might include how the digital age impact resource control and trade, how global resource distribution impacts energy security and utilization, and how international resource competition impacts the climate. Ultimately, the class is led to an understanding about how scarcity has impacted cultures throughout human history (US & IL).The tentative plan is that each lecture period consists of two parts starting with a moderator (the lead faculty member throughout the entire semester) who summarizes the resource under discussion in a 10-15 minute introduction. Then, appropriate EMS faculty will offer detailed accounts of their particular expertise. This format requires two 75-minute classes per week (30 per semester).The moderator shall be responsible for grading the class including the discussion and written responses in a large classroom format (50+ students) taught in one lecture hall.

EARTH 105N Environments of Africa: Geology and Climate History (3) (GN/GS;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Environments of African: Geology and Climate History investigates the interrelationships between geology, hydrology, land use, societies and human development in several areas of Africa. We focus primarily on regions north of the equator, although there is a brief segment on South Africa mining. Specific topics include the Nile River (sources of the Nile, agricultural practices, effects of damming the Nile, hydropolitics), the Sahara and Sahel (salt mines, climate change, drought, water resources), and natural resources and their role in politics (gold, diamonds, oil, and gas). The theme of climate change cuts across the entire semester. The quantitative and analytical components of the course involve working through a combination of map exercises and data manipulations (flood stage, groundwater age, rainfall and temperature records). Writing exercises are conducted both individually (essays, analysis of readings) and in collaborative teams (climate change analysis). Readings for the course come from the popular scientific literature; current refereed research journals, and transcribed oral histories of African people. Faculty lectures will comprise ~30% of the course, and student presentations ~20%, with the remainder of the time devoted to in-class collaborative exercises. There are no pre-requisites for this course. It will be offered annually with a maximum enrollment of 100 students.The goals of the course are to (1) explore the relationship between human society and the natural world; (2) develop quantitative and scientific reasoning skills; (3) introduce the scientific study of Africa. The topics that we explore (e.g., global climate change, allocation of limited water resources) are important political issues that affect people in developed and developing countries throughout the world. It is crucial that the next generation of citizens be informed as to how scientific data is obtained, presented, and interpreted by scientists as well as politicians. Students will work individually and (more commonly) in teams to analyze real data from natural African systems, and will then report their findings to the class both orally and in writing. Examples of the data sets include 100-year records of monthly rainfall and temperature from stations throughout the continent, fossil suites from ancient lake cores in the modern Sahara, and historical writings of Nile flood levels from pre-Biblical times.

Unconventional energy development from shale formations has been a game changer for the fossil fuel industry over the past decade and is projected to continue to grow over the next several decades. But there are still many uncertainties on how to optimally develop these largely untapped resources to maximize the social benefits while minimizing environmental impacts. This course covers key topics needed to provide students with an overview of the science, engineering, environmental impacts, geopolitics, economics and societal impacts of shale energy development. These topics include geology, resource assessment, drilling technology, hydraulic fracturing methods, environmental impacts, economics, workforce needs, infrastructure, utilization trends, regulation, energy policy, energy exports, international geopolitics, societal considerations, and the future of unconventional energy and its relationship with other energy forms. The class is geared toward a broad audience of students to provide a big picture view of the shale energy landscape. The course is structured in four parts. The course begins with the geology of shale (part 1), then examines engineering and environmental aspects of shale energy production (part 2), then explores relevant economic, geopolitical and societal issues (part 3) and ends with a capstone project (part 4). Shale energy development in a key U.S. shale basin is used in parts 1 -3 to provide examples and illustrate concepts, impacts and problems.

Students begin by examining key macroeconomic variables, including nominal and real interest rates, nominal and real GDP, unemployment rates, and potential economic growth. A two-period consumption model is also analyzed with the life cycle theory of consumption. Economic models are studied to analyze these topics, and macroeconomic goals for a society are discussed. After acquiring many analysis tools, the course discusses general equilibrium, where formal theories can model a variety of shocks that hit the macroeconomy and the corresponding reactions in a variety of markets. Related topics include the production function, marginal productivity of capital, firm investment, labor demand, labor supply, marginal product of labor, the supply side of the economy, and aggregate demand. After establishing a solid understanding of general equilibrium, students will examine the Federal Reserve, monetary policy, the market for reserves, open market operations, and quantitative easing. The course finishes with lessons comparing and contrasting classical economic theory vs. Keynesian economic theory. The strengths and weaknesses of each theory are considered relative to the business cycle data.",3,3,Prerequisite:  ECON 104

The course will cover topics similar to those covered in ECON 306 but with more mathematical rigor (i.e., using calculus). Following an introduction and reviews of probability and statistics, the course will focus on: (1) the statistical properties of commonly-used estimators and test statistics in regression models, (2) how to use them in practice for statistical inference, and (3) the issue of endogeneity and instrumental variables. Students will study both practical and theoretical aspects of econometrics, by which they will be able to implement the basic methods in practice and to understand the limitations of these methods. This course is an honors version of the second quantitative course in economics that is now required of all economics majors. As noted above, students will learn both theoretical and practical aspects of econometrics, so that they will be able to carry out econometric analyses of data. Evaluation of student performance will be based on homework assignments, midterm exams, and a final exam. Typically, the homework assignments would account for 20 percent of the overall course grade, each of two midterm exams would count for 25 percent of the grade, and the final exam would count for the remaining 30 percent of the grade. This course has ECON 106/106H, Statistical Foundations for Econometrics, as a prerequisite, and will use calculus.

Students will learn about why nations trade and the effects of trade on both consumer and producer. Some people will gain and some people will lose from trade and students will learn how to measure gain and loss from trade. This class also introduces trade barrier policies imposed by the government such as tariff, quota, subsidy and other commercial policy such as dumping and countervailing duty. The creation of the international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are discussed. Later in the course, the Macroeconomics side of the international trade is discussed as well as the Balance of Payments, which is a way to summarize and measure a countries trade with the rest of the world. Students will also examine some of the basics of the foreign exchange market and the relationship with the interest rates.

ECON 408W Intellectual Property (3)We live in a society that has a decentralized system based on the institutions of private property and trade. In such a system, things belong to people and can be transferred by their owners to other people. An exchange that moves something to someone who values it more than its present owner produces a net benefit, which may be shared between the parties to the exchange. Thus such a system tends to move everything to those who most value it, producing an efficient allocation of goods and services. The logic and limitations of this process make up the branch of economics called price theory. The course undertakes an examination of intellectual property, a subfield of property rights. In the context of intellectual property, there are five specific areas of note: patent races, poorly constructed incentives, standards, licenses, and an examination of costs. There are three factors relevant to the costs of providing legal protection to some particular sort of intellectual property. One is how easy it is to define and defend property in that sort of idea. Another is the degree in which someone who creates and claims ownership in that particular sort of intellectual property reduces, by so doing, the options available to other people. The more serious these problems are, the less the gains from defining and enforcing property rights in ideas. Where they are sufficiently serious, we are better off with an intellectual commons--a legal regime in which certain classes of ideas are free for all to use than with intellectual property. These three costs must be balanced against the benefits--production of more and better intellectual property and better coordination of intellectual property once produced. The larger these benefits are likely to be, the greater the costs we are willing to bear in order to get them. The course objectives are to apply the framework of comparative and cost-benefit analysis to the study of intellectual property. The course will examine the empirical evidence, and also consider policy issues in this area.",3,3,Prerequisite:  ECON 402 or ECON 444

More precisely, the course will focus on economic theories of discrimination and on efforts by economists to measure the extent of labor market discrimination. An important objective of the course is thus to learn how economists conceptualize and study discrimination. This, in turn, requires that we examine how economists view and study economic differences by race, ethnicity, and gender (these are the types of discrimination that will be focused on in the course, although we will also consider other types of discrimination). Following the existing economic literature, much of our emphasis will be on labor market discrimination, but we will also consider discrimination in education and in housing. The first substantive section of the course outline below involves examination of data on the economic characteristics of women and blacks in relation to white males, considering both the current situation and recent trends. Data on Hispanics will also be presented. This work will be done by the students, working in groups. We will look at how mainstream economists conceptualize economic differences by gender and by race/ethnicity, respectively. Then we will focus on formal models of discrimination and empirical issues in attempting to measure discrimination, and we'll also examine an alternative approach to understanding economic inequality.

ECON (H P A) 445W Health Economics (3)The healthcare sector comprises a set of markets that differ in some significant ways from the textbook model. In the US, this sector performs well in some respects and questionably in others. Notably, there has been sustained improvement over time in life expectancy and other indicators of the effectiveness of health care for most people, but the resources devoted to producing this improvement have been growing considerable faster than GDP. The goal of this course is to examine several broad questions raised by these facts. The course begins with an overview of evidence on wealth, health expenditure, and life expectancy across countries, and then examines increasing life expectancy and medical expenditures in the US and their causes. Issues in measuring the value of medical expenditures are addressed, and an overview of the industrial organization of health care is provided. A major component of the course covers the economics of health insurance, and the course also examines medical R&D and the pharmaceutical industry as well as issues in the financing of medical care for the elderly. The course seeks to introduce students to the economic analysis of health care. It is in the area of applied microeconomics, and deals with issues relating to labor markets and public finance, in particular. This writing-intensive course will be one of several 400-level W seminars that the Economics Department is seeking to establish, with the broad objective of exposing our advanced undergraduate students to economic analysis in a seminar setting requiring significant writing by the students.

This course includes topics that examine the economics of mergers as well as economic policy with regard to mergers. There often are both pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects of mergers. In the U.S. the Federal Trade Commission has primary responsibility for assessing the balance between effects. Along with the FTC, the antitrust division of the department of justice can analyze potential mergers using economic data and forecasts with tools such as the HHI and four-firm concentration ratio. Legality of non-competitive markets and mergers is also analyzed using the Clayton and Sherman antitrust acts. Topics discussed related to pro-merger economic effects include reduction in the duplication of costly capital, economies of scale, reducing costs by cutting management, human resources, payroll, and other jobs not directly related to production of output. Further, some firms may contend that they are non-viable as a small business, but can survive as a larger competitor as the result of a merger. Finally, mergers may have positive implications for shareholders who effectively own the company. Negative effects of mergers topics are discussed, including a reduction in the number of competing firms, increase in market power, higher prices, reduction in consumer choice, and increased lobbying power of larger firms. This course examines unilateral effects and coordinated effects as identified in the horizontal merger guidelines. Vertical mergers are analyzed as well, where multiple parts of the production process of a final good come under the same ownership. Econometric issues associated with the measurement of unilateral and coordinated effects are discussed. The course concludes with ex-post merger reviews.

The content begins with a brief history of experiments in economics. Then it outlines key features of experimental design and an introduction to the basics of game theory, which are commonly utilized in experiments. After establishing the basics, the course investigates decision making under uncertainty and compares how various theoretical explanations predict actual human decisions. We then discuss bargaining experiments and bargaining theory. The course concludes with a description of common behavioral influences and biases in judgment and decision making.

The course begins with a short review of the traditional labor market variables (labor force participation, employment and unemployment, earnings) before viewing specific topics relevant to developing countries. These topics include rural vs. urban labor markets and the factors that influence individuals in each setting, industry regulation by national and international law, efficiency wages in growing industries, worker safety, compensating wage differentials, and comparative advantage. Particular emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects that each of these issues may face in developing countries compared to developed countries. These unique issues include microloans, mercantilism, economic nationalism, the effects on conflict on economic growth, growth models exhibiting high marginal productivity of capital and technology, growth indicators, sector-specific growth, industrialization and deindustrialization, balanced growth theory (Ragnar Nurkse), foreign investment, trade barriers, tariffs, and exchange rates. The course is an advanced seminar in the broad area of development economics. The course objectives are to enable students to learn about labor markets in developing countries, how they are different from as well as similar to those in industrialized countries, and the problems and policy issues that pertain to these labor markets.

CMPEN 417CMPEN (E E) 417 Digital Design Using Field Programmable Devices (3)Field Programmable Devices, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs) are widely used for rapid prototyping and quick response-time designs. The objective of this course is to introduce the student to digital design using Field Programmable ICs, and to provide an understanding of the underlying technologies and architectures of these Integrated Circuits.The course begins by introducing design alternatives for modern electronic systems identifying and classifying alternative system solutions, and evaluating when particular design solutions are optimal. These alternatives include microprocessors, microcontrollers, off-the-shelf digital ICs, Programmable logic ICs (FPGAs and CPLDs), and various forms of Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) designs. A homework assignment requires the student to quantitatively evaluate the cost, complexity, packaging, and time-to-market issues for a complex system design specification.Next, the underlying Field Programmable Logic IC architectures and technologies are studied in detail. Following a broad survey of available programmable IC vendors and on-chip programming technologies (and their cost/performance trade-offs), several specific case studies are presented in the class. The first is the Xilinx XC4000xl line, because of the target boards used in the CAD laboratory component for this class. The initial lab portions of the class help the students to specify their design using various forms of design entry tools and also allows them to see how their design map on to the underlying FPGA architecture. The students also learn the underlying algorithms used by the design software they use in their Labs.Next, the systematic top-down method for specifying complex designs using VHDL is introduced. Students are given a supporting homework assignment to develop high-level behavioral models for a simple digital system to reinforce this segment of the course. VHDL behavioral synthesis is now introduced as a preferred path to go from high-level system behavior to actual implementation on the FPGA. The strengths and weaknesses of synthesis are discussed, as are the emerging CAD tool trends. Additional VHDI-based homework assignments reinforce behavioral design and synthesis using commercial CAD tools.The final segment of the class covers special topics that identify current trends in digital system architecture and programmable logic design. These include such topics as partially reconfigurable architectures and dynamic reconfiguration techniques, system design for testability, and field programmable analog arrays. Applications of FPGAs in special purpose computing environments such as signal processing, Java acceleration and image processing are also introduced. In the laboratory, student design project assignments explore larger and more complete system specifications of such things as controllers, CPU and memory design, and signal processing blocks. These assignments reinforce the lecture content as the students model, synthesize and implement their digital designs on the target Xilinx FPGA boards.",3,3,Prerequisite:  CMPEN331

EGEE 210 Technological Legacy of Pennsylvania Coal (3) (GN) Pennsylvania Coal, a natural resource, has touched many lives from past to present with profound influence on employment, economic growth, social and political relationships, culture, and the natural environment in the state. The heritage and legacy of Pennsylvania coal weave the story of the Industrial Revolution in the U.S., including technological, social, and environmental aspects. Coal continues to be an important natural resource for electricity generation and metallurgical coke production to manufacture iron and steel. In 2000, approximately 80 million tons of coal was mined in Pennsylvania, most of which was used to generate electricity (approximately 62% of total electricity generated in Pennsylvania). Development of new technologies addresses the challenges of preserving and protecting the environment while mining and burning large quantities of coal. Health and safety of U.S. coal miners have been improved significantly over the past century. However, the recent Quecreek Coal Mine incident in Somerset, Pennsylvania reminded that underground coal mining is still a dangerous profession. Many PSU students have personal links to the coal industry through family members who have been engaged in coal related careers over several generations. This course will provide an opportunity to study coal mining practices in Pennsylvania that their parents and previous generations experienced with a review of recent improvements in these practices.This course will survey the development of the science and technologies (utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach) of coal formation, coal mining, coal transportation, and coal utilization.

ENGR 426ENGR (MGMT/IST/ENTR) 426 Invention Commercialization (3) The goal of ENGR (MGMT/IST/ENTR) 426 is to have students understand why invention commercialization is complicated and difficult by participating in the process. For example, the inventor rarely has insights into the markets for his/her invention, is often not interested in the details of commercialization, and can be secretive. In addition, the business and financial communities often do not take the time, or have the resources, to understand new technologies and perform complex due diligence. Thus lack of due diligence often leads to rejection of innovation because existing companies often discount new technologies from outside the company as NIH - 'not invented here'. Effective transfer of new invention or innovation to a commercial product requires at least three different functional communities to interface: technical, legal and business. Each uses a different language, comes from different educational and cultural backgrounds, and may have an inherent distrust of the others. These functional barriers are difficult to overcome.This course teaches how these barriers can be broken down as student teams help bridge the perceived chasm between key players in the invention commercialization process. In these teams, students bring the skills and knowledge from their major to develop an invention commercialization recommendation for the Technology Transfer Office and the inventor. For example, business students focus on finance and market opportunity assessment; engineering and IST students focus on design refinements, prototyping support, and (if appropriate) making technology suggestions to the inventor.Upon completing the course, the students will have a working knowledge of different university and corporate technology or invention commercialization processes, important intellectual property management tools for inventions (patents, license agreements, option agreements) source of funding to move inventions toward product development, and delivering top quality presentations which outline the recommended commercialization path. Students who enjoy open-ended projects which involve the interplay of business and invention of who wants to work on interdisciplinary teams with the newest inventions will find this course a valuable course.

ENGR 455 Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship Reflection and Research Dissemination (3) The HESE Reflection and Research Dissemination course provides students an opportunity to reflect and build upon their experiences following the EDSGN 454 class involving travel to the partnering community to advance their HESE venture. There are three intertwined themes. One theme explores the ethical intricacies of conducting research and advancing entrepreneurial ventures in developing communities. The grassroots diplomacy theme delves into the complicated and delicate challenges of working in developing communities in a harmonious and effective manner. The research dissemination theme provides students with just-in-time information and skill-sets necessary for developing their research manuscripts into refereed publications. Post-travel reflection on ethical issues: This theme explores the ethical intricacies of conducting research and advancing entrepreneurial ventures in the context of developing communities. The ethics-related discussions help students reflect on their experience and develop a mindset where they want to make better ethical decisions because they are emotionally engaged and can effectively assess the implications of their actions. Grassroots Diplomacy: During their field experience, HESE students interact with diverse parties including local communities, non-governmental organizations, governmental and UN agencies, religious organizations, political groups, bureaucrats, local industry, US corporations, tourists, etc. Students observe and experience ego and community tensions and dynamics. They might get asked for grease payments or be propositioned for dowry. They might experience conflict or observe other groups, or their own group, compromise the core concept of self-determination. Workshops in the grassroots diplomacy theme delve into the complicated and delicate challenges of working in developing communities in a harmonious and effective manner to catalyze social change with their technology-based ventures. Research Dissemination: HESE students are engaged in an IRB-approved research study related to their venture, for which they gather data during the summer field experience. This workshop series provides students with just-in-time information and skill-sets necessary for developing their research manuscripts. The workshops lower the barriers to the scholarly dissemination of their work. Sharing designs, business/implementation strategies, and lessons learned is extremely important for the praxis of HESE worldwide. For examples, published designs for low-cost greenhouse can help people in many world regions. A paper on the non-technical challenges to the growth of the small-scale wind power industry in Kenya served as a starting point for a windmill venture.",3,3,Prerequisite:  EDSGN454

Students travel to project site(s) for three weeks to advance their ventures by conducting field-testing of their technologies, testing their preliminary business models, and gathering data for research projects. They work closely with community members and various partnering agencies during the course. The partnering agencies range from community members to non-profits, community-based organizations, and governmental and United Nations agencies. Students work in cross- national cross-functional teams and make several presentations to community members, potential partners and investors. In the past, HESE students have worked in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, India, El Salvador, Jamaica, Ecuador and other countries. There is no set schedule for the three weeks in the partnering community. A (two-hour long) debriefing meeting is held every evening to discuss progress made by all the teams on that day and decide the action plan for the next day. Administrative issues, technological challenges, ethical or diplomatic issues are also discussed in this meeting and solutions are developed by consensus. The field experience is also a rich environment for students to explore the ethical intricacies of engaging in projects in international contexts. Students engage in debates on ethical issues related to science, technology and society in an applied setting -the people are real, the ethical dilemma is real and most importantly, a consensus is required to address the ethical issue and decide on the further course of action. A collaborative and integrated approach of system design, business strategy, and implementation strategy development is employed. The process of operationalizing the design and the business / implementation strategies is as important as the product itself. This integrated design and implementation process encompasses conceptualization, validation, design, field-testing, implementation, and evaluation, all done in an iterative fashion.

E SC 123S Catastrophic Failures (1) (FYS) Engineered Systems sometimes fail in catastrophic ways. Bridges collapse, buildings bum, airplanes explode, ships break in two, spontaneous combustion occurs, automobiles crash, etc. Virtually all such failures occur because the designers, builders, and or the users have overlooked some unexpected combination of inputs (they seldom fail due to simple overload). For example, a bridge designer may have overlooked (a) the potential danger of aerodynamic loading and mechanical resonance; (b) having a bridge mooring struck by a tugboat; or, (c) the possibility of an earthquake. The ship designer may not have expected a combination of very cold weather and large waves or bad materials, etc. This seminar explores design deficiencies through the study of cash histories of a number of famous failures such as the explosion of the Challenger (modern era) and the sinking of the Titanic that caused catastrophic loss of life.

Building upon a basic foundation from early Physics courses, it offers an introduction to the behavior of electrons in crystalline as well as non-crystalline solids, and its impact on properties. A comprehensive treatment of electrons in solids is essential to understand the electronic, optical, thermal, magnetic and other properties of materials and their incorporation in functional devices. The topics are chosen to deal with all the basic facets of electrons in solids and their response to external fields and waves, and lead up to a broad range of elementary device applications. It thaws upon the results of quantum mechanics and band theory of solids that provide the broad umbrella needed for understanding the properties of materials and designing them into practical devices including the new class of nanosystems. The development of the energy band diagram is shown to offer a convenient model for understanding the properties of materials and designing device structures.

Students will learn strategies for researching, ""reading,"" and understanding the verbal and nonverbal folklore of diverse communities. The class may include readings on cultural traditions drawn from Native American, Latinx, African American, and immigrant cultures, as well as other folk groups defined by social identities such as age, occupation, gender, sexuality, or religion. By the end of the course, students will be able to recognize the cultural, political, and historical implications of such traditions.

3476,ENGL 181A,ENGL,181,A,Adventure Literature: Exploring the Chesapeake Bay,"Examines the interconnection of culture and nature in the Chesapeake Bay region through the literature of the region.  ENGL 181A Adventure Literature: Exploring the Chesapeake Bay (4.5) The course focuses on a specific place--the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed--that has generated a distinctive regional identity and literature from its natural and social context. The course begins consideration of the concept of watershed, both as a geographical concept and a literary metaphor, before turning to an examination of the culture(s) and nature of the largest and most important tributary of the Bay, the Susquehanna River. Students will read texts associated with the history and the development of the Susquehanna, with some emphasis on logging, rafting, mining, and hydropower development. Readings here should aim at helping students see how a regional cultural identity has evolved from the river's geography and economics. Focus on the Bay itself, students can learn similar lessons. We begin by looking at the rich native cultures that occupied the region before the advent of Europeans and then move to initial European exploration and settlement. The class might then focus on development (agricultural, cultural, and industrial) of the Bay and Bay Region generally, through readings that might include regional histories and literary works like James Michener's Chesapeake: A Novel. Significant attention should be devoted to the sub-culture of the Chesapeake waterman, a regional identity that has generated its own mythology and folklore and has been the focus for numerous writers. Texts might be chosen to show the role nostalgia plays in conceptions of the Bay or the ways in which issues of race, class, and gender are raised by examining representations of the waterman culture. What students should see is how literature and culture are transformed over time, while resonances of former place identities remain. Finally, the course will turn to the Bay as it is today and how the representation of place and regional identity in literature has changed over time.This course was designed to include out-of-the-classroom educational experiences on the Susquehanna River and other tributes of the Bay and on the Chesapeake Bay itself. The trips should provide students opportunities to fully understand the interconnections of nature and culture in the Bay region. They should also allow students the chance to travel in the footsteps of the writers they read in venues throughout the region. The goal is to both see how a distinctive culture derived from the natural circumstances of the Chesapeake and to understand how that culture might continue (or not) into the future.",5,5,Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesUnited States Cultures (US)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key LiteraciesGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason
3479,ENGL 181D,ENGL,181,D,Adventure Literature: Exploring the Literature of American Wilderness,"The purpose of ENGL 181D -""Exploring the Literature of American Wilderness""-is to study the literature and ideas associated with American wilderness in an experiential context; that is, the heart of this course should be an extended backpacking trip into a federally protected wilderness preserve. So the basic assumption on which this course is founded is that our understanding of literature and other cultural concerns can be enhanced by knowledge of and experience in a place. To achieve its purpose, this course will expose students to the following: ¿ The history of wilderness in American culture, including the ongoing political debate about the meaning, value, and place of wilderness/wildness in that culture. ¿ A representative sampling of the writing that has been directly inspired by wilderness experience. ¿ Philosophical ideas directly associated with wilderness experience. ¿ The rudiments of safe and low-impact backcountry travel and the manner in which to engage in that travel most ethically. ¿ The direct experience of legally protects wilderness itself. ¿ An opportunity, however briefly, to experiment with the Thoreavian notion of ""living deliberately. To accomplish this purpose, students will be asked to accomplish some reading and writing (of various types). In a version of this course previously offered, the exploration of the literary representation of wilderness over time-from Puritan historians and Enlightenment philosophers; to Thoreau, John Muir, and Theodore Roosevelt; to contemporary poets, novelists and literary journalists-is framed by reading Roderick Nash's standard history of wilderness in the United States, Wilderness and the American Mind",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesUnited States Cultures (US)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key LiteraciesGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason

ENGL 182C Literature and Empire (3) (GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. ENGL 182C will constitute a wide-ranging study of literature written in English, including novels, short stories, poems, plays, and prose, from countries that were once part of the British Empire or some other European empire. The class will approach this literature from a variety of thematic, historical, and/or generic vantages. Authors under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include writers such as Chinua Achebe, Buchi Emecheta, Alan Paton, David Malouf, Robertson Davies, Ngugi Wa Thiongo, J. M. Coetzee, R. K. Narayan, Amitabha Ghosh, Salman Rushdie, Christina Stead, Thomas Keneally, Jill Ker Conway, V. S. Naipaul, Wilson Harris, and Michael Ondaatje. Topics under consideration will vary from class to class, but the course will often discuss matters of race and ethnicity, as well as matters of religion, gender, sexual orientation and global context, where appropriate. The principal emphasis of the works in this course will be the recognition of non-European/non-American societies and the differences between their culture and that of Europeans or Americans. The conflicts generated by clashing cultures will drive the choice of readings. By the end of the course, students will have studied works from a minimum of five different cultural perspectives. This class will also prepare students to consider social and cultural problems from a variety of cultural perspectives. Students will be evaluated by means of essays written in and out of class, essay exams, term-long reading journals, and class participation.

3485,ENGL 184,ENGL,184,,The Short Story,"This course is designed to introduce students to the art of the short story and to acquaint them with some of its most talented writers. During the semester we will read short stories from various cultures and countries, ranging from stories written in the early nineteenth-century to those written within the last few years. Readings will include works from authors like Hawthorne, Melville, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gogol, Bierce, Chekhov, Kafka, Chopin, Crane, Gilman, James, Cather, Joyce, Woolf, Faulkner, Hemingway, Lawrence, Orwell, O'Connor, Baldwin, Olson, Silko, Erdrich, Ondaatje, Barth, Barthelme, Atwood, Mukherjee, Walker, Tan, Calvino, Garcia Marquez, and Cortazar. All readings will be in English. This course is intended to help one learn how to read fiction, how to understand it, and how to talk about it. The desire to tell stories and to be told stories is one of the most basic human needs, and all cultures have been defined in part by the stories they hear and the stories they tell. We are not born knowing how to read the short story or any fiction for that matter. Rather it is a skill that one acquires, and the more one does it, like playing tennis or any other activity, the better one becomes at it, for we learn what to look for. We will explore the historical development of the short story genre, and examine how historical contexts relate to the content and style of the stories under discussion. We will become familiar with how stories are put together and with the vocabulary that is used to discuss fiction--terms such as plot, narrative, character, tone, language, closure, irony, imagery. and so forth. CMLIT/ENGL 184 is not required for the CmLit major but may be selected to fulfill one of the course requirements for the major or the World Literature Minor.

3488,ENGL 190Q,ENGL,190,Q,Medievalism,"In English 190Q / INART 203Q students will gain an understanding of medievalism, defined by Leslie J. Workman in 1987 as ""the study of the Middle Ages, the application of medieval models to contemporary needs, and the inspiration of the Middle Ages in all forms of art and thought."" As this definition suggests, understanding medievalism and, thus, the popular works students know, such as Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings' benefit from learning something about the Middle Ages and the reach of its re-mediation across various kinds of expression. Therefore, ENGL 190Q / INART 203Q begins by introducing students to medieval works and a few of the forms that characterize it. More particularly, the medieval works to be studied are those combining more than one genre, media, and/or form. For example, students will read and listen to (or sing!) medieval lyrics, read and perform short medieval plays such as Robin Hood, be introduced to manuscripts of the bestiary with its illuminations, historiated letters, and scribal copying. They also will be introduced to Romanesque and Gothic architecture The first medievalist remediations--works adapted in other media--to be examined will be Book I of Spenser's Faerie Queene, with the woodcut of the Redcrosse Knight and Dryden/Purcell's King Arthur, which will introduce students to Early Modern English medievalism and how it reflects prevailing values in new combinations of old and new artistic forms. Still greater emphasis will be placed on the English Medieval Revival of the nineteenth century, including John Ruskin and the PreRaphaelites poetry, paintings, and essays, as well as William Morris's poetry, painting and Arts and Crafts Movement. Then, as now, medievalism served multiple purposes, including aesthetic, political, and social. To put into practice what students learn and to engage their creativity, one assignment involves hand crafting an art project to be accompanied by an artist statement. In the last part of the course, the focus shifts to contemporary medievalist arts and theory. In keeping with the contemporary direction, another assignment asks students to remediate their handcrafted medievalist work, or to create a new one, using digital resources to engage both their creativity and understanding of key medievalist concepts.",3,3,General Education: Arts (GA)General Education: Humanities (GH)General Education -  Integrative: InterdomainHonorsGenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking

Students will learn through an integrated and ongoing process of interpreting select comics texts and also making their own work in that same medium. Students will gain a technical vocabulary for discussing and assessing comics, which they will then apply to formal analysis of compositional and narrative elements in select assigned texts. This analysis will occur first in class discussion, facilitated by the instructors, and then through a sequence of individual written assignments. At the same time, students will receive formal instruction in making comics as they create their own work over the course of the semester, workshopping with peers and instructors as a way of gaining further insight into the creative and technical processes of the studied texts. Formal analysis and creative work will be coordinated and progressive across the course of the semester.

ENGL 194S Women Writers (3) (GH;US;IL;FYS)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. English 194 will constitute a wide ranging study of works by American, British, and other English-speaking women writers, including novels, short stories, poems, plays, and prose. The class will approach this literature from a variety of thematic, historical, and/or generic vantages. Authors under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include writers such as Bradstreet, Wollstonecraft, C. Rosefti, M. Shelley, Austen, C. Bronte, E. Bronte, G. Eliot, D. Wordsworth, Dickinson, Wharton, Stowe, Freeman, Jewett, Fuller, H.D., Moore, Sitwell, Bishop, Brooks, Plath, Cather, Woolf, Stein, Lessing, Bowen, O'Connor, Welty, Porter, Oates, Olsen, Sarton, Gordimer, Atwood, Morrison, Kinkaid, McCarthy, and Churchill. The course seeks to make students aware of the extensive body of literature written by women through the analysis, evaluation, and appreciation of specific works by women writers. The course also seeks to help students understand the female perspectives-the varying values and interests of women--reflected in the texts at hand and to position these perspectives within wider social, historical, and political contexts. The course also seeks to make students aware of the special problems faced by both women writers and the female inhabitants of the societies they describe in their work. As a course in women's literature, ENGL/WMNST 194 concerns itself with questions of gender. In so far as some of these women writers are black or women of color, it concerns itself with questions of race and ethnicity. In as far as the course looks at women's literature in the context of men's literature, it is concerned with the inter-relationship between dominant (male) and non-dominant (female) culture in the United States as well as in Britain. In so far as the course covers lesbian writers, it is concerned with sexual orientation. Topics under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include a chronological introduction to the development of women's literature, a consideration of a principle theme or themes common to women's literature through a number of works from across a number of historical periods, a consideration of a number of women's works in the context of historical events central to their creation, a consideration of a number of women's works in the context of formal or aesthetic elements common to those works and their various effects. Time allofted for the study of the works under consideration will vary. This class will prepare students for advanced courses in women's literature as well as other academic courses that engage in the verbal and written analysis of complex written texts. Students will be evaluated by means of essays written in and out of class, essay exams, term-long reading journals, and class participation.

3509,ENGL 208N,ENGL,208,N,The Music of the Beatles and American Popular Culture,"The Beatles are the most significant musical group in the history of popular music. Their songs are derived from diverse sources, such as rhythm 'n' blues, rock 'n' roll, country 'n' western, Motown, soul, folk music, folk rock, the British Music Hall, and European and Indian classical music traditions. Two ideas define their work: an emphasis on freedom, and how song texts can be interpreted in different ways. The Beatles had a great impact not only on American popular music during their heyday in the 1960s but also on the country' s popular culture in which they were considered philosopher kings. Beatle albums mirrored changing trends in the culture, from the pre-Vietnam War youthfulness of A Hard Day's Night, to the psychedelia of Revolver and Sgt. Pepper, to the countercultural mindset of The White Album. This inter-domain course will focus on how the Beatles influenced American popular culture from the 1960s to the present day. It will examine how the Beatles were a part of a mid-twentieth-century British youth subculture that was shaped by the cultural attitudes of American rock 'n' roll. The course will then turn its attention to the seismic shift initiated by the Fab Four in both music and pop culture in the US from 1964 to 1970, demonstrating how it has permeated the popular culture of the 1970s to the present day. The course will enhance the appreciation of the Beatles and their music through its interdisciplinary focus, contextualizing the Fab Four's work in order to show how both popular music and culture can influence one another.

Both instructors will be present in the classroom throughout the semester, providing joint presentations and leading discussions. The integration of humanities and natural sciences domain content will encourage students from humanities and natural science backgrounds, as well as other interested students, to take the course and learn how to integrate these two domains of knowledge in their education and their lives after leaving Penn State. This course teaches both basic concepts of chemistry and their cultural elaboration in literature, and it models a critical assessment of the implications of chemistry and literature emerging from a shared cultural field, rather than autonomously from two separate cultures. The course seeks to provide students with a nuanced understanding of how literature and science inform each other and negotiate cultural, religious, and political tensions. Understanding the origin and development of these ideas, perspectives, and discoveries is an essential component of science and scientific achievement, but too often our methods of teaching science focus almost exclusively on   teaching facts and theories at the expense of the historical discovery, creation, and development of those facts and theories. This courses teaches both the scientific facts and theories and the contexts of their production in order to sharpen students' abilities at critical evaluation of facts. The literary and scientific focus will vary from class to class, but may include writings by literary authors such as Mary Shelley, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Bram Stoker, H. G. Wells, Garrett Serviss, Aldous Huxley, Roald Hoffmann, Carl Djerassi, Don DeLillo, William Butler Yeats, Arthur Machen, D.H. Lawrence, A. E.

However, these subjects will be interwoven throughout the semester. Indeed, the pedagogy of the course depends upon the literature and the science not being neatly separated from each other. Instead, students will learn up-to-date science while exploring the origins, development, and cultural dimensions of that science, and will learn to integrate their understanding of the domains of science and the humanities through the course.

3539,ENGL 245,ENGL,245,,Introduction to LGBTQ Studies,"An introduction to the dominant themes in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies, with an emphasis on both literary & cultural studies. This course explores the history of modern, western ideas about sexual identity as manifested in literature, theater, film, and other narrative forms of popular culture. Drawing on the substantial body of ""queer theory"" generated by scholars in the humanities since the 1990s, this class examines sexuality not as a ""natural"" or consistent phenomenon, but as a set of beliefs that have changed over time and manifest themselves differently in different cultural and historical contexts. Starting in the late nineteenth century, scientific and medical authorities began categorizing individuals into sexual types based on their manifestations of gendered characteristics and their erotic attractions and practices. This medical typing corresponded with the development of subcultures associated with deviance from sexual norms; these subcultures produced a rich variety of texts, images, performances, and social forms, many of which became central to both popular and high culture. This course explores this rich archive, moving among media. It investigates constructions of sexual conformity and how sexual nonconformists positioned themselves in relation to cultural and medical group identities. It examines how distinctions between gendered, raced, and classed bodies were historically produced and culturally contested. It considers what commonalities gay identities may - or may not -- share with lesbian identities and how transgender and other identities have altered perceptions of sexual identity. The course also explores the relationship of the avant-garde to the mass media and how sexual subcultures have shaped literary and other cultural forms of expression. Comparative study of issues of sexual mobility beyond and between the borders of the United States expands the course's critical scope beyond dominant forms of western culture. This course does not propose definitive answers to the questions of identity it addresses. Instead it negotiates the ways sexualities have enabled individuals to articulate -- and disarticulate -- themselves within social bodies past and present. This course, therefore, has wide relevance for students interested in how group identities come into being and transform over time in dynamic relation to other historical forces. Exploring a wide variety of cultural forms associated with the history of sexual identity as well as a variety of interpretations of that history, this course opens students to an archive of literature, theater, film, and other narrative arts with the potential to inform and enrich their understandings of many kinds of challenges to regimes of normativity today.",3,3,Cross-listed with: WMNST 245United States Cultures (US)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason

One variation will focus on Literature and Censorship by first considering general arguments for and against censorship and then by examining texts by writers who sought publication in their own country but whose books were censored or banned. The course will consider such questions as, Are there ever legitimate grounds for censorship? How do standards of censorship differ between countries? What is the relation between censorship on political and on moral grounds? What does artistic merit have to do with concern about moral or political subversion? Works from England, South Africa and the United States will be read and discussed, and where available, excerpts from trial transcripts will be read in order to examine arguments for and against publication. Readings will include works by Milton, D. H. Lawrence, Alan Paton, Nadine Gordimer, Athol Fugard, Eugene O'Neill, Henry Miller, and Alan Ginsberg.Another variation will focus on war and gender in 20th century American literature by examining the ways male and female authors write about war. Texts will vary from battlefield experiences to repercussions of war to the symbolic implications of war. Questions will be raised about literary authority: Does one need to be combatant to write about war? If not, how does one find the authority to speak, particularly as a woman? How does race and/or ethnicity complicate one's perceptions of American participation in war? Readings will include works by Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Joseph Heller, Cynthia Ozick, Leslie Marmon Silko, Norman Mailer, Bobbie Mason, Tim O'Brien, and Toni Morrison.Another variation will focus specifically on the writings which emerged from the postwar African-American struggle for civil rights. The course will include not only fiction and poetry but also those speeches, sermons, editorials, and other forms of discourse to have emerged from the era. The emphasis will be both traditional literary concerns as well as on the various rhetorical strategies involved in each work. Ideally, the course would make visible to students the difficulties attendant upon any attempt to separate the concerns of rhetoric and persuasion too firmly from the concerns of literature. The course could conclude with a look at some of the various biographies, autobiographies, and histories written over the last twenty-five years, which attempt to shape our national memory.Other variations include literature as a response to Newtonian science or to Darwinism or to the American Depression or to postwar technology or to new dystopias or to AIDS or, as in the sample outline, the Civil Rights movement.",3,3,"Prerequisite: ENGL 15; ENGL 15A; ENGL 15S; ENGL 15E; ESL 15; ENGL 30H; ENGL 30T or ( ENGL 137H, ENGL 138T )"

3584,ENGL 424,ENGL,424,,Creative Writing and the Natural World,"Creative writing workshop focused on the environment and related issues.  ENGL (ENVST) 424 Creative Writing and the Natural World (3) American literature includes a long and rich tradition of writing that focuses on the natural world. From the oral stories of indigenous people to the journals of the first European settlers, many have looked for a way to understand their own place in the world based upon their relationship to the earth and its creatures. While Puritans often discerned the pleasure or wrath of God in the environmental changes they experienced, Transcendentalists like Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson sought out moments of spiritual enlightenment by immersing themselves in the natural order. More recently, such poets as Galway Kinnell, James Wright, and Robert Bly have attempted to connect with the depths of collective unconsciousness by exploring the natural world, while others, like Mary Oliver, Dan Gerber, Jim Harrison, Gary Snyder and Wendell Berry, have used transcendental thought and melded it with Christian and Buddhist insights. Still others, like Gary Paul Nabhan, Rachel Carson, and Alison Hawthorne Deming have brought science to bear upon the riches that nature, art, and scientific exploration may offer when joined in the pursuit of a deeper understanding of, and relationship with, the natural world. This course will acquaint students with the tradition of American nature writing, as well as contemporary nature writing, in the genres of nonfiction, poetry and fiction. Students will be introduced to issues of style, philosophy, and content, as they produce their own essays, poems, and stories. The course culminates in the production of a portfolio of nature writing. Much of this work will begin in class with specific assignments, which will include field work, and feedback from other students in the class. As a workshop course in creative writing, the emphasis will be upon the production of literary texts that interact with the natural world and upon the revision of those texts.",3,3,Prerequisites: ENGL 50 or ENVST 100N

ENGL (J ST) 427 Topics in Jewish American Literature (3) This course will provide sustained examination of major themes, texts, and figures in the Jewish American literary tradition. The course will focus on depth rather than breadth in its analysis of the defining aspects of the literature and on what the literature reveals about Jewish American culture and identity. The United States has absorbed large numbers of Jewish immigrants from many parts of the world, holding many different ideas about Jewish practice, and affiliating themselves with many different political, social, and cultural traditions, and moreover Jews have settled and made homes in a wide variety of American communities. Close analysis of literature will therefore provide an opportunity to consider the constitution, origin, and development of Jewish America's wider cultural, political, and social contexts. Materials will consist predominantly of primary texts, including prose fiction and nonfiction, poetry, drama, and film, and the methodology will emphasize the close reading of these texts. The course complements offerings in Jewish Studies, English, and Comparative Literature. Most obviously, the course will offer students of Jewish literature, world literature, and American literature an opportunity for contextualization. It enables students in Jewish Studies to study the rich literature of American Jews, and it adds to courses covering Jewish American history, religion, and culture. The course offers students in English and Comparative Literature a valuable, sustained introduction to an important U.S. and world sub-culture and -literature.",3,3,"Prerequisite: ENGL 15; ENGL 15A; ENGL 15S; ENGL 15E; ESL 15; ENGL 30H; ENGL 30T or ( ENGL 137H, ENGL 138T )"

Departing from Concord, the course will explore Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, both of whom read and were inspired by Emerson. Finally, the course will include works by Herman Melville, who formed a friendship with Hawthorne prior to writing Moby-Dick.

3626,ENGL 468,ENGL,468,,African American Poetry,"Meta duEwa Jones argues, ""We cannot afford to continue to treat black poetry and poetics as loose change among the more highly valued paper currency of fiction and nonfiction prose. . . . The myriad aesthetic forms and concomitant political functions of black poetry and poetics should be seriously considered as grounds for broader and more nuanced theoretical and sociocultural claims."" This course takes as its subject matter these aesthetic forms and political functions of the poetry of black America. It surveys the broad history of African American poetry and poetics, tracing the evolution of formal structures and aesthetics, but also taking a critical view of the reception of African American verse. Whether reading Phillis Wheatley or the contemporary poet Ed Roberson, all the poets included in this course have contended within the writing itself with the racially striated nature of the literary spaces they occupy. Course readings may come from poets including Wheatley, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Alice Dunbar Nelson, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, Robert Hayden, Melvin Tolson, Gwendolyn Brooks, Amiri Baraka, John Coltrane, Ishmael Reed, Nathaniel Mackey, Rita Dove, Maya Angelou, Audre Lorde, Natasha Tretheway, Sonia Sanchez, Nikki Giovanni, Nikky Finney, Roberson, Claudia Rankine, and others. The course addresses works by many of the key figures of this American literary tradition so that students may develop an understanding of the various contributions and legacies formal, musical, cultural, critical, political of African American poetry from the eighteenth century to today. Scholarly readings accompany primary texts to give students a sense of the critical work that has gone into and continues to go on in the study of African American poetry and poetics. The course surveys early African American poetry through works from the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Arts Movement, and through contemporary movements and formations. Topics will cover a range of thematic and formal issues relevant to individual poets, to major movements and periods, to regions, and to various smaller organizations and collectives. Course assignments, lectures, and discussions engage students in critical work that requires careful attention to form, content, and context such that all students might strengthen their explicatory skills and approach course figures and texts from an informed, analytical perspective.",3,3,Prerequisite: ENGL 15 or ENGL 15A or ENGL 15S or ENGL 15E or ESL 15 or ENGL 30H or ENGL 30T or ( ENGL 137H and ENGL 138T )

3635,ENGL 478,ENGL,478,,Grant Writing,"Grants can do many things. Let's say you are a student who has always dreamed of combining help for food-insecure people with support for the mentally ill homeless. You've written papers about it for classes; you've read lots of research that points to past pitfalls and future innovative possibilities--but now you want to make it real by finding funding for the program you've envisioned. Or maybe you have your sights set on finding an existing non-profit foundation that might serve as a fiscal conduit for grants that will feed the cause you feel passionately about. These scenarios and many others call for finding and winning a grant. Here's what grants can't do: Write themselves. Given that writers of grants do not have one how-to professional manual to rely on, professional grant-seekers must learn to have flexible responses to a variety of writing situations. Every grant proposal is different, as is every population with a problem to solve, and every organization hoping to help with the solution. A successful grant-writer achieves confidence with hands-on practice-confidence earned from mastering the underlying principles of effective research and outreach; feasible and complete content-generation; and the writing of precise, clear, audience-centered prose. English 478 will provide you with the basic knowledge and practice needed to get you on your way to professional confidence. Six Main Learning Goals: * Comprehensive understanding of the grant-writing field * Strategic use of research skills to match program to foundation, need to grant-maker * Beginning mastery of all elements of the basic proposal, including: mission match, objectives that fill a proven need, evaluation strategies that reliably measure outcome, a feasible budget, and proof of capacity and sustainability * Practice of skills most needed in the current economic and political climate, including collaboration, diversified funding, and innovation within an established organization * Practical use of social media and cultivation skills for sustainability of project * Mastery of applied rhetorical style emphasizing clarity and precision",3,3,"Prerequisite: ENGL 15; or ENGL 30; or (ENGL 137, ENGL 138) and (ENGL 202A; or ENGL 202B; or ENGL 202C; or ENGL 202D)"

3647,ENGL 490,ENGL,490,,Women Writers and Their Worlds,"American and British literature written from the perspective of women.  ENGL (WMNST) 490 Women Writers and Their Worlds (3) (US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. ENGL/WMNST 490 covers particular aspects of American and British literature written from the perspective of women. The courses stress the diversity of women's authorial worlds, both through time and/or space. The readings and specific focus vary from semester to semester. ENGL/WMNST 490 seeks to make students aware of the extensive body of literature written by women, but, unlike ENGL 194, which is a survey course of women's literature, ENGL/WMNST 490 can be a more intensive course, focusing on selected themes and topics of particular concern to women as reflected in the poetry and fiction of twentieth-century American and British women writers. The class can also be taught in relationship to earlier periods, dealing, for instance, with English women novelists from 1775-1865. In such a class, readings would include fiction by Fanny Burney, Mary Wolistonecraft, Ann Radcliffe, Jane Austen, Mary Shelly, Emily Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot. The course would then place each novel in its historical, social, intellectual, and literary context, and explore the various ways in which some of England's best writers transformed their female experience of the world into fiction that extended the range and influenced the development of the novel. Regardless of the particular focus, all sections of the course pose the following questions throughout: Do women use the same myths, archetypes, and literary conventions as male writers? Or do they sometimes have to modify the myths, archetypes, and literary conventions originated by their male precursors in order to adapt them to female experience? Is there such a thing as a distinctively female imagination, with a symbolic language of its own? Is there such a thing as a chain of literary influence linking women writers to each other? What are the strategies for coping with the anxieties of authorship? What is the interaction between gender and genre? In what ways are creativity and procreativity modes of defying prevailing ideologies? Does a woman's psychological development have an effect on the plots a woman novelist conceives? How does women's literature reflect the realities of women's lives? As a course in women's literature, ENGL/WMNST 490 concerns itself with questions of gender. In so far as some of these women writers are black or women of color, it concerns itself with questions of race and ethnicity. In as far as the course looks at women's literature in the context of men's literature, it is concerned with the inter-relationship between dominant (male) and non-dominant (female) culture in the United States as well as in Britain. In so far as the course covers lesbian writers, it is concerned with sexual orientation. Students should expect to complete a minimum of three written assignments in the course, two course papers, and an essay final exam in class. The papers each will ask students to choose a text to analyze in relationship to one of the thematic modules the course has chosen, for instance, to discuss how Virginia Woolf s Mrs. Dalloway analyzes the position of upper-middle class women in a particular moment in history when women had achieved the vote, but were still largely constrained by patriarchal social norms. In addition to written assignments, students will be evaluated on class discussion and general participation. The course not only prepares students for taking up literary and cultural analysis in English classes, but also in any other class that engages in the verbal and written analysis of complex written texts, and in other classes in Women's Studies or in other Penn State departments that address the social, cultural, or ethical issues of gender. The course may be used as English Major elective credit or as credit towards the English Minor; it may also be used in the Women's Studies major and minor. It will be offered once a year with 40 seats per offering.",3,3,Prerequisite:  ENGL 015 or ENGL 030

ENVST (ENGL) 424 Creative Writing and the Natural World (3) American literature includes a long and rich tradition of writing that focuses on the natural world. From the oral stories of indigenous people to the journals of the first European settlers, many have looked for a way to understand their own place in the world based upon their relationship to the earth and its creatures. While Puritans often discerned the pleasure or wrath of God in the environmental changes they experienced, Transcendentalists like Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson sought out moments of spiritual enlightenment by immersing themselves in the natural order. More recently, such poets as Galway Kinnell, James Wright, and Robert Bly have attempted to connect with the depths of collective unconsciousness by exploring the natural world, while others, like Mary Oliver, Dan Gerber, Jim Harrison, Gary Snyder and Wendell Berry, have used transcendental thought and melded it with Christian and Buddhist insights. Still others, like Gary Paul Nabhan, Rachel Carson, and Alison Hawthorne Deming have brought science to bear upon the riches that nature, art, and scientific exploration may offer when joined in the pursuit of a deeper understanding of, and relationship with, the natural world. This course will acquaint students with the tradition of American nature writing, as well as contemporary nature writing, in the genres of nonfiction, poetry and fiction. Students will be introduced to issues of style, philosophy, and content, as they produce their own essays, poems, and stories. The course culminates in the production of a portfolio of nature writing. Much of this work will begin in class with specific assignments, which will include field work, and feedback from other students in the class.

FIN 406H - Security Analysis and Portfolio Management (Honors)(3) Finance 406 is about how to invest money in stocks, bonds and derivative securities. The course focus is on creating portfolios of assets rather than on picking individual assets for investment. To create a portfolio of assets, the portfolio manager must have knowledge of the assets available for purchase, the markets the assets are traded in, and the statistical and mathematical techniques needed to assign weights to the assets within the portfolio. The manager must also be able to predict changes in the economy that justify changes in the portfolio, as well as be able to evaluate the performance of the portfolio relative to standard benchmark portfolios such as the S&P500.The course begins with a review of the structure of the asset markets, basic pricing formulas, fundamental and technical analysis, and the tools from previous statistics, economics, and calculus classes needed. Different models relating risk and return such as the CAPM and arbitrage pricing model are covered. These models exemplify how investors are willing to trade-off the variance in returns from investments with the expected value of the investment. The students then learn how to choose the weights to assign to each asset available to maximize the expected return while minimizing risk of the portfolio using the portfolio theory of Markowitz. While the focus of this section of the class is on investing in equities, the portfolio theory learned is applicable to all types of assets. Because there are important differences between stocks and bonds, the next section of the class focuses on the unique characteristics of fixed income securities. Models explaining the different risk and return characteristics of bonds are examined. Because fixed income securities prices and returns are directly linked to changes in interest rates, theories of what determines interest rates are presented and applied to evaluating the performance of portfolios including fixed income securities. The course concludes with an overview of investment in options and futures contracts. The basic pricing models for these types of assets are reviewed as well as practical concepts of investing in derivatives such as margin accounts and creating synthetic returns using combinations of different types of options.As an Honors course, the level of research and academic investigation is enhanced with outside journal readings in topics such as portfolio theory, anomalies and market efficiency, overpricing, and current topics in Portfolio Management as material is published.

FOR 418 Agroforestry: Science, Design, and Practice (3) (US;IL) Agroforestry is the intentional design of land use systems that combine tree crops with plants and/or animals in a manner that seeks to promote ecological and economic benefits within the landscape. Two possible arrangements for such systems are (1) the integration of trees within non-forested settings; and/or (2) the introduction of high value 'crop' species into existing forestlands. The objective of the course is to foster a practical working knowledge of agroforestry as it is experienced both in Pennsylvania and throughout the world, so that students from a variety of backgrounds can integrate agroforestry practices and thinking into their own disciplines, interests, and lives. Although agroforestry is an ancient land use approach, it is new in many places, and improvements and adaptations to traditional practices are needed to meet local circumstances. This course will provide a framework for critical assessment and implementation within this context.One of the fundamental aspects of agroforestry is that it is a land use system that operates at a landscape or ecosystem scale. For agroforestry to succeed, many factors, including ones external to the agroforestry practice itself must be considered. Therefore the course is interdisciplinary in nature and topics in ecology, economics, sociology, and policy that are related to agroforestry practices will be discussed. In evaluating the students, the primary emphasis is on class discussion. Students will be expected to review and discuss papers and contribute to the ongoing dialogue and debate about agroforestry as a sustainable land use. Students will be required to carry out critical reviews of agroforestry papers and publications as well as design and develop an agroforestry project pertinent to their individual field of interest and expertise.

The course is also designed to help students perfect reading, writing and oral communication in French. The course starts with a brief history of the press in France, including the creation of dailies such as Le Journal de Paris and the impact of some well-known journalists or writers upon events such as the Dreyfus Affair. It will then focus more specifically upon the origins of high-circulation, contemporary newspapers and magazines. Quickly moving to the post-WWII period, students will be introduced to radio and television in France and, as they become more familiar with French and Francophone press and media, will be given several opportunities to study current or recent events of the French and Francophone world, in fields such as sports, politics, culture and economics. Library holdings and internet sites will allow the class to regularly read daily newspapers such as Le Monde and Le Figaro and view newscasts on channels such as TF1 and FR2.

FR 419 French Semantics (3) The aim of this course is to provide upper level undergraduate students in French with a relatively informal introduction to the field of semantics as it applies to the French language. Semantics is the subfield of theoretical linguistics that seeks to make explicit the rules native speakers use to interpret stable aspects of the meaning of natural language sentences. The course will begin by comparing and contrasting semantic and pragmatic aspects of meaning -an important undertaking since only the former are assumed to be subject to invariable rules of grammar. The conclusions reached in this portion of the course will then be extended to account for a very special type of language -humor -in a particular context, France. That as, it will be shown that a more complete understanding of this linguistic behavior entails recognition of the relative contributions of pragmatics and semantics. We will then turn to a survey of the classic model-theoretic approach to lexical and compositional aspects of semantic meaning, with important (sociolinguistic) refinements to the standard approach to lexical semantics being discussed in detail. With a survey of the fundamentals of the field in place, we will then undertake an investigation of specific topics in semantics, looking first at the status of thematic roles in semantic theory (focusing on work by David Dowty). Here we will examine the important implications his work holds for the initial mapping of arguments into sentence structure, not only for primary transitive verbs, but also unaccusative and psych-verbs. We will then examine current analyses of causation in French, certain aspectual distinctions, and semantic, pragmatic, and syntactic approaches to negative and positive polarity items, n-words, and minimizers.",3,3,Prerequisite:  FR   316

FR 460 Contemporary French Literature (3) This course is designed for advanced undergraduate work and it is taught in French. To function well in this course, students need to have passed an intermediate introductory course to French literature. The primary goal of FR 460 is to facilitate students acquisition of a coherent view of major contemporary literary movements, from modernism in poetry and drama, through surrealism, both lay and Christian humanistic fiction, and existentialism, to the absurd theatre, the nouveau roman, and post-modernism, ecriture feminine, anti-colonial and post-colonial literatures. Major authors are presented thru one of their works, taking into account the cultural, historical context in which they were developed. Instruction also comprises an initiation to basic theoretical notions on genres, literary techniques, and critical reading methodology. Contents will vary according to instructors choices but balance between periods, movements and genres is implied.  Multi-media resources abound for the purpose of illustration and interdisciplinary considerations but the primary thrust is cultural/ literary enrichment, and the development of students reading and analytical skills in French.   Web resources, excerpts, and shorter whole texts will be incorporated to the reading materials and will supplement the required books. Students are expected to read between ten and thirty pages according to the level of difficulty of the materials. No manual or anthology has been established a satisfactory choices for this course even though such tools exist, they generally do not treat the last third of the period properly.  So FR 460 instructors have relied on a variety of primary texts to achieve as comprehensive yet coherent a survey of this overflowing century as possible.

4028,FSC 432,FSC,432,,Petroleum Processing,"Transportation of people and goods in many parts of the world depend almost completely on petroleum fuels, such as gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, and marine fuel. Apart from the fuels, materials that are necessary for operating the combustion engines of cars, trucks, planes, and trains also come from petroleum. These materials include lubricating oils (motor oils), greases, tires on the wheels of the vehicles, and asphalt to pave the roads for smooth rides in transportation vehicles. All petroleum fuels and many materials are produced by processing of crude oil in petroleum refineries. Petroleum refineries also supply feedstock to the petrochemicals and chemical industry for producing all consumer goods from rubber and plastics (polymers) to cosmetics and medicine. This course explains how physical processes and chemical reactions that take place in separate petroleum refinery units are integrated to convert crude oil into desired fuels and materials. Refinery processes are divided into four types that include separation, conversion, finishing, and support. The overall objective of petroleum refining is to convert crude oil into fuels and materials that comply with commercial specifications and environmental regulations. All refining processes and refinery operations are also subjected to the applicable environmental regulations. A historical evolution of process concepts is introduced to demonstrate how the refining efficiency has increased with significant reduction of pollutant emissions from individual refinery processes. The principal objectives of this course are to enable students to: 1. explain the market drivers for the refining industry (ABET student outcome 2). 2. indicate what crude oils consist of and how crude oils are characterized based on their physical properties (ABET 1, 2); 3. express the objectives of petroleum refining and classify the processes used in petroleum refining (ABET 1, 2, 7); 4. demonstrate how a petroleum refinery works and sketch a flow diagram that integrates all refining processes and the resulting refinery products (ABET 2); 5. examine how each refinery process works and how physical and chemical principles are applied to achieve the objectives of each refinery process (ABET 1, 2, 7); 6. assess implications of changing crude oil feedstocks on refinery configuration and propose strategies to resolve conflicts with degrading crude oil quality and increasingly stringent environmental regulations on petroleum fuels (ABET outcome 4, 7); 7. discuss different sources of natural gas and explain how natural gas is processed at well sites and in processing plants with application of selected refinery processes and other physical operations (ABET 1, 2).",3,3,Prerequisite: CHEM 202; CHEM 210

This course will focus on the myriad ways that narrative arts and physical sciences relate to the development of technologically mediated virtual worlds. Designing the physical and narrative voyages of avatars through virtual worlds is necessarily a team-centered undertaking requiring recursive editing from a macroscopic and microscopic point of view to refocus project goals and deliverables. Besides learning the requisite computing and technical skills involved in virtual world development, students enrolled in this course will produce a world design proposal, and storyboards, interactive fiction graphics, or world maps for their virtual world; in this way, they will explore some of the ways that creative writing, particularly interactive fiction and storytelling techniques drawn from non-VR and VR gaming contribute to the planning, design, and execution of virtual worlds. Students will also learn about the basic science behind virtual world concepts such as the physical environment, physical processes (e.g. kinematics, motion), and light; ultimately, they will produce an immersive time-space experience in their proposed world and reflect on the complexity of integrating design elements in a way that creates a satisfying immersive experience. The objectives of the course include: (1) students will work in teams to design a proposed virtual world using world making principles found in interactive fiction narratology and physical principles that embody the avatar and allow it to move in a virtual world environment; (2) students will work in teams to construct a virtual scene, movement in time/space, from that world using computer software tools and mediated through virtual reality hardware; (3) students will be able to discuss developing immersive technology and applications of virtual worlds in business, society, and academia; (4) students will analyze and critique the virtual world designs of other student teams; (5) students will demonstrate comprehension of interactive fiction scene and level structures and world maps as they relate to designing the voyage of the avatar in a virtual world; and (6) students will demonstrate comprehension of physical principles (e.g. kinematics, light) as they apply to virtual worlds.

GEOG 010GEOG 010 Introduction to Physical Geography (3) (GN)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.Introduction to Physical Geographysystematically examines the spatial patterns and interrelationships among physical elements at the earth's surface. Particular emphasis is given to developing an integrative view of how atmospheric, hydrologic, geomorphic, and biotic processes control the patterns of climate, water, landforms, soils, and biota across a local-to-global continuum. Those physical elements that influence and/or are influenced by people are the primary focus of study.Physical geography does not simply discuss the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere in isolation; instead, it concentrates on understanding theintegrationof these realms of the natural world. For example, the study of weathering processes demonstrates how the physical and chemical breakdown of Earth's surface material depends on the interaction of air, water, and biota with rock.The focus of physical geography is unlike the component disciplines from which it draws. On the one, hand, meteorology focuses on the atmosphere above our heads. Hydrology focuses on water in isolation from people. Geology and soil science focus on the Earth beneath our feet. Biology and ecology focus on the plants, animals, and ecosystems in isolation from people. One the other hand, physical geography concentrates on the surface of the Earth where the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere intersect.Introduction to Physical Geographyis concerned with the human habitat-the life layer in which humans interact with their natural world.Like all geography, five recurring themes permeateIntroduction to Physical Geography : location, place, regions, movement, and human-environment relationships. Physical geographers not only are interested in where natural phenomena are located on Earth's surface, but also they want to know the answers to such questions as:1. What is special about the physical processes that take place in a location? 2. How does the physical geography of a place relate to other places in the region? 3. How does energy and mass flow into and out of a region? 4. How do biophysical processes change as we move up and down spatial scales? 5. How do people influence natural processes? How do these processes influence people?Other disciplines typically do not cover these spatial and nature-society themes systematically.Physical geographers have developed and adopted many tools to address these themes. Maps are obvious choices, but geographers also use a wide array of photographic and imaging technologies to study the distribution of Earth processes and the processes themselves. They use geographic information systems and computer models to manipulate, display, and analyze spatial data.Introduction to Physical Geographyacquaints students with many of these tools.When the above points are taken together, physical geography emerges as a unique field of science.Introduction to Physical Geographyprovides a learning experience that students can get in no other discipline-one that takes an integrated view that makes the nature environment relevant.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: Natural SciencesGeneral Education:  Natural Sciences (GN)

A major theme in the discipline of geography is the study of the relationships between humans and the natural environment. GEOG 230 introduces students to the multiple ways in which people and the environment are interconnected. From a dynamic systems perspective, we refer to this interconnectedness as 'coupled social-ecological systems.' The course uses a geographic perspective to understand how differently these linkages are shaped in various ecological and cultural settings around the globe. The course follows an interdisciplinary approach, exploring from multiple angles major environmental and societal challenges such as climate change, genetically-modified food, over-consumption, disease, and environmental service provision in the industrialized North and the Global South. It promotes critical thinking regarding key concepts such as carrying capacity, ecological footprints, feedback, stability domains, and resilience. Students are encouraged to examine their role and responsibilities for the sustainability of the social- ecological systems we inhabit and to take action in their own lives to contribute to a more equitable and sustainable environment. The course will provide students with the opportunity to read, learn, and debate about the ways in which humans value, use, affect, and are affected by small-scale and large-scale human-environment interactions. It will provide them with skills for critically analyzing and evaluating the ways in which humans have transformed the environment in different parts of the world. They will also learn how to assess what future pathways are sustainable and ethically sound. One key goal of the course will be to help students increase their sensitivity to the global and international context of human interactions with nature. A discussion section allows students to explore controversial issues such as biotechnology, nature as a commodity, and global warming, and to develop critical positions on such issues. Through attendance of lectures, participation in discussion sections, and completion of reading and writing assignments, successful students will:  -build an interdisciplinary understanding of how biophysical and social environments are intertwined and shape one another -comprehend the range and importance of different disciplinary approaches to researching human-environment systems - develop a toolkit of key concepts and theories for understanding human-environment systems and evaluating questions of sustainability - evaluate and critique different perspectives for intervening in human-environment interactions, including sustainable development, deep ecology and degrowth.",3,3,

4082,GEOG 310,GEOG,310,,Introduction to Global Climatic Systems,"This intermediate-level course in Climatology emphasizes geographic patterns of interannual climate variability (climate variations) and physical processes responsible for those variations (climate dynamics). Interannual climate variations include regional- to large-scale anomalies of temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, etc., that may manifest as extreme weather (drought, floods, heat and cold waves, etc.). The physical processes associated with these fluctuations include the following: interactions among climate-system components (atmosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere); external forcing (e.g., solar variations, volcanic activity); and long-distance interactions involving coupled atmospheric-ocean circulations, or teleconnections (El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Arctic Oscillation (AO), and the Pacific-North America (PNA) pattern). Climatic teleconnections manifest shifts in the atmospheric pressure ""centers of action"", storm tracks, long waves, jet stream positions, etc. We study the patterns and processes of regional climate features such as the South Asian and West African monsoons, ""nor-easter"" snow storms, Arctic/Antarctic sea ice variations, the summer/winter transition in Mediterranean-type climates, the role of ""blocking"" in middle-latitude climate variations, etc. Also, the course examines the role of human activities in climate, particularly the ""global warming"" related to increases in greenhouse gases, biomass burning, desertification, deforestation and afforestation, urbanization, irrigation for agriculture, and jet aviation. A key issue addressed is the role of human activities in possibly altering the frequency and intensity of teleconnections, especially ENSO, and of severe storms (thunderstorms, tornadoes) and hurricanes. The possibilities for geo-engineering the climate are also considered. In understanding the physical processes of climate, students are better able to assess the extent humans are a factor in contemporary climate changes. Course Objectives: 1. Understand how climate variables depict the characteristic patterns of climate and its variations on local/regional to hemispheric/global scales (climate diagnostics); 2. Evaluate the physical processes responsible for those climate and weather variations and their role in regional-scale phenomena (climate dynamics); 3. Assess the role of human activities in contemporary climate changes, on scales of the urban heat island to global warming (human impacts on climate); Upon completing this course, students will understand the geographic patterns (regional to global) and physical processes associated with climate variations, trends and changes on seasonal through interannual to decadal/multi-decadal temporal scales.",3,3,Prerequisite: GEOG 210 or GEOG 10; or METEO 3; or METEO 201

It explores the problems, promises and paradoxes of international violence and the efforts to address violence through human rights initiatives and international peace movements. Particular emphasis is given to developing an integrative view of how global, national and local scale processes interact to produce patterns of peace and conflict. The course analyzes how individuals, the state and other political actors engage with geography to produce violent or peaceful outcomes. GEOG 328 does not simply explore issues of violence and peace from a ""top-down"" perspective that focuses on the nation-state and international, state actors. Rather, it focuses on the multiplicity of perspectives and actors that come together to create violent or peaceful conditions. As a result, this course explores violence and the broader movement to address violence through human rights initiatives. We will explore violence and peace in the 20th and 21st centuries, the ways the organization of space and place is linked to violence and peace, and how international efforts to address violence and war are linked through time and space. This course also dissects the definition of human rights, the idea of 'just war' and the way peace movements may both sustain and undermine efforts at ending violence. Course Objectives: The overarching goal of this course is to educate us about the legacies of violence and the struggle to construct a more just and peaceful world. At the end of the semester students should be able to: 1) Define and articulate different notions of violence and recognize how the definition of violence is related to diplomatic efforts at addressing human rights violations. 2) Understand the relationship between violence in one area of the world and resulting broader geopolitical power dynamics, especially the human-territorial considerations of violence and peace. Learning Outcomes: At the end of this course students should be able to: 1) Identify and define structural violence. 2) Explain the differences between positive and negative peace. 3) Define human rights, and explain their connection to geopolitics. 4) Explain how truth processes work, and identify their strengths and limitations. 5) Identify how the definition of peace changes at different scales.",3,3,Prerequisite: GEOG 220 or GEOG 20

GEOG 333 Human Dimensions of Natural Hazards (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Natural hazards -such as earthquakes, tsunami, volcanoes, and floods  are not simply forces of nature. Their impacts depend on the interaction between the hazardous events and the characteristics of people, their communities, and the human systems in which they operate. The physical dimensions of natural hazards require knowledge of physical science, and the human dimensions of natural hazards call for knowledge of social science. Nevertheless, understanding natural hazards means not only that students know the physical and social sciences, but also that they know how nature and society work together to increase or decrease potential harm posed by these phenomena. This course introduces students to the topic by surveying the range of natural hazards and by applying important social science perspectives, such as risk, vulnerability, and the true costs of hazards, to each of the hazards. Because the study of natural hazards is interdisciplinary, readings, lectures, and discussions address crucial aspects of both natural and social sciences. GEOG 333 has two goals: (1) to develop understanding of a set of issues related to the human dimensions of natural hazards; (2) to develop and apply communication skills by discussing, writing about, and presenting on natural hazards. The specific content of the course will change with the instructor, but the focus on interactions between the natural and human worlds and on skill-development in writing and speaking will be constant. Students will be evaluated on both the course goals: (1) understanding of the human dimensions of natural hazards; (2) application of communication skills.

The focus is on recent and future global warming, but we will spend some time looking at climate changes of the past, as context for the future. The emphasis is on the physical science behind questions of global and regional climate changes, but we will also pay some attention to shorter-period climate variations/teleconnections and their impacts on human systems (as possible analogs of future climate change). Because scientific discovery and analysis takes place within a particular social context, we will consider the values, ethics and responsibilities of scientists in general, and specifically in the contexts of geoengineering to minimize or reverse global climate changes. Climate change topics include radiative forcing, greenhouse gases and aerosols, scenario development using statistical and dynamical approaches, equilibrium GCMs versus time-dependent models. Important climate variation topics are droughts, floods, heat/cold waves, and the role of teleconnections; notably, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation and Arctic/Antarctic Oscillations. Because most professional research on climate change and variation involves collaborative science teams, this course emphasizes collaboration and participation. Course Objectives 1. Provide students a basic understanding of the climate system and the internal and external forcings that produces climate variability and change over varying time scales. 2. Introduce students to the tools of the trade how statistical and global climate models work and why they are used. 3.

GEOG 432Y Historical Geography of North America (3) (US)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This is an upper-division, writing-intensive course that presents an overview of current scholarship on the evolving historical geography of the continent. It does this through a set of lectures given by the instructor, through directed readings that will be the basis of class discussion, and centrally through research essays that offer students the opportunity to research, write and argue historical geographies. Research in historical geography is a process of engagement with partial evidence and with secondary material to open windows on aspects of past lives, past economies, and past places. Since an introductory level overview of the historical geographies of the continent is presented in GEOG 122: The American Scene, this class does not offer a comprehensive survey of regions and periods. Rather, it focuses on three themes -staples and the colonial era, local transformations in agricultural and industrial communities in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, and the packaging of memory as a way to expose students to primary evidence and current debates.In the unit on the colonial era, the focus is on a variety of records that illuminate the development of economies based on staples such as fish, fur, tobacco, rice and iron, drawing on evidence from the Lords of Trade and Plantations in London, and from correspondence between merchants and planters, as well as scholarship on the material culture of houses, farms and settlements. For the unit on local change, workshops illustrate how to tease out information from the manuscript census, county atlases and corporate histories; students then pursue similar material for a locale of their own choice and submit drafts of an evolving research essay. A short presentation to the class encourages the effective distillation of visual and data evidence to communicate research findings. On the packaging of memory, the class critically examines how historic sites are presented, and how interpretations have changed in response to shifting academic and popular concerns. Lectures are interspersed with discussions of readings, workshop demonstrations, and by student presentations. Eleven distinct writing exercises are used as the basis of allocating the overall grade.",3,3,"Prerequisite:  GEOG 122 , 3 additional credits in geography or 6 credits American history"

4127,GEOG 433,GEOG,433,,Geographies of Justice,"The justice concept has been a topic of interest within various academic and policy realms concerned with the inequities experienced by racial groups, socio-economic class, and ethnicity. The environment justice movement is generally understood to have begun in the early 1980s with a series of events that demonstrated the inequitable distribution of health hazards and risk. While much work in environmental justice has usefully focused on the disproportionate exposure of poor and minority populations to environmental hazards, conceptualizations of justice have expanded in recent years to include systematic and comparative research within urban and rural populations, industrialized and developing contexts, access to and control over resources, as well as unwilling exposure to hazards, processes and institutions of environmental governance. These trends have resulted in greater attention to the social processes that create and perpetuate inequality on the basis of race, gender, income, or other social categories. In exploring the 'fast conceptual transfer' of the environmental justice concept to other settings, Walker and Bulkeley (2006: 655) suggest emerging interest in distribution between nation-states, an expansion of terms to include gender, age and future generations, and intersections with the vulnerability literatures to examine the threat of natural and produced risks. This course engages with the history and future of social and environmental justice. We begin by examining the emergence of the environmental justice movement in the United States and subsequent export of the justice concept to other topics, including sustainable development and climate change, and within other settings, including Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. In exploring the diverse ways that justice is being applied at the present time, we will also question the future viability for justice as a conceptual and organizational tool. Course Objectives This course has four primary objectives: - Examine the history of the concept of environmental justice and the environmental justice movement in the United States; - Consider multiple definitions of environmental justice such as procedural and distributive justice; - Examine the application of the environmental justice concept to other topics, including sustainable development and climate change, and within other settings, including Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America; and - Consider future directions for environmental justice.",3,3,
4130,GEOG 437W,GEOG,437,W,Energy Geographies and Policy,"This course explores the motivations, key concepts, and contemporary challenges of US and international energy policy. The approach of the course is inherently geographical in that we engage the concepts of scale, place, landscape, and materiality to evaluate energy policy issues. The course addresses the following questions: 1) Why and how is energy governed? 2) How does energy policy differ across political scales and energy sectors? 3) Who are the key stakeholders influencing energy policy? 4) How are the costs and benefits of energy policy distributed? 5) How can a geographic perspective advance energy policy making? 6) How well do existing tools and policy frameworks address emerging challenges in energy policy and governance? The course is designed to explore these questions through interactive discussion, drawing on examples from various political levels and in various geographical contexts. A combination of independent writing and presentations will provide students with the expertise to be careful and critical observers of policy developments, and to prepare students for future roles as policy advisors in business and government settings. The course is divided into four parts: 1) overview of US and international energy policy; 2) key concepts and debates in analyzing energy; 3) case studies; and 4) emerging issues and challenges. After successful completion of this course, students will be able to: 1. Analyze the origins, motivations and distributional impacts of U.S. and international energy policies; 2.

GEOG 444 / AFR 444 African Resources and Development (3) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course is designed to analyze the ecological, economic, political and cultural factors, which influence development in sub-Saharan Africa. The traditional system, colonialism, modernization, post-colonial philosophies are four conceptual artifacts used to address some of these issues. Within these broad frameworks, the course focuses on existing debates surrounding key development ideologies and narratives in the region, including, poverty, conservation, population, debt, food security, land reform, foreign intervention and global politics. The topics and texts for the course are chosen carefully to provide general factual material as well as exposure to the major discourses surrounding the region's development. The views of many Americans concerning Africa are often both unitary (Africa is a country) and unidimensional (Africa is a place of conflict, poverty, corruption and crisis). Assuming that a number of students are likely to join the class with this general background, the main objectives of the course will be :  (i) to provide a broad geographic and historical tutorial to dispel myths and stereotypes about the region;  (ii) to explore the literature, which analyzes the historical, geographic and political factors that underlie the region's present status in the global economy; and (iii) to gain insights into the intellectual and ideological dimensions of the ""raging"" debates surrounding issues like environment, conservation, population, corruption, and poverty in the region. By the end of the semester, students should have acquired the skills to accomplish the following goals: *develop a ""mental map"" of the broad physiographic, ecological, economic and political zones (blocs) in the region; *be able to discriminate between stereotype and reality on information pertaining to the region; *be able to interpret and analyze the internal (national, regional) dynamics of the region's development; *be able to interpret and analyze the global factors, which influence the environment, economy, and politics of the region; *develop an informed background on the ideological narratives that guide policy in the region, for example, population, sustainable development, post-colonialism, ""empire"" (whether, American, European, Indian, Chinese, South African?).",3,3,Prerequisite:  GEOG 010 or GEOG 020 or GEOG 030 or GEOG 123 or GEOG 124 or GEOG 130 or EARTH105 or AFR  105 or AFR  110

Geography 464 is a course in methods for analyzing spatial data--methods that can and should be used when the geographic arrangement of a set of measured observations is thought to be of significance in explaining the values of those measurements. The methods of spatial analysis looked at in this course can be distinguished from conventional statistical analysis techniques, and also from many of the analysis functions programmed into many GIS packages. In fact several spatial analysis methods considered in this course the result of attempts to alter and extend conventional statistical techniques to take account of locational similarity and distance measurements (which is why Geography 364 or an equivalent primer in introductory statistical methods is a prerequisite). This means that the techniques that will be introduced in the course are often quite complex mathematically or statistically.

4169,GEOSC 10,GEOSC,10,,Geology of the National Parks,"Geology of the National Parks"" uses the unsurpassed features of national parks to address the key questions of geology and the environment. Each topic is introduced with a virtual field trip to a specially chosen national park (involving pictures of the park, a brief history, other highlights of the park, with supplemental materials and links provided on-line). Key questions about the park (Why has Death Valley been getting wider? Why is much of Mt. St. Helens spread across neighboring states?) then motivate discussion of the topic (here, the spreading or squeezing associated with drifting continents), with special attention to implications for humans (for example, predicting earthquakes and volcanic eruptions associated with these features). A suite of exercises provides the opportunity for analytical experience. There are no prerequisites for the course; however, students must meet the university's technical requirements for running Canvas. This course is offered online during the fall, spring, and summer sessions. The goals of the course are to help students learn how certain common-sense ideas allow science to be such a successful human endeavor, that the Earth efficiently but slowly recycles almost everything, that the Earth's environment has been nearly balanced for very long times, that human-induced changes are among the fastest Earth has ever experienced, and that the National Parks are critical but challenged living laboratories, museums, and repositories of biodiversity. In doing so, the students will see the applications to real-world problems of related fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics, and will develop a greater appreciation of these other subjects.

4178,GEOSC 107N,GEOSC,107,N,"Rocks, Minerals, and the History of Art","This online course investigates select rocks and minerals used in the production of art between the Prehistoric Era and the Early Modern period. Topics covered include chemical and physical properties, occurrence in nature, the processes by which natural materials are acquired and worked, their symbolic and monetary value, and specific works of art in which they are found. Each material (ochre, garnet, lapis lazuli, rock crystal [quartz], igneous rocks [basalt, diorite and porphyry], alabaster and marble) is addressed in a 2-week unit. The seven units are split equally between scientific analysis of the materials and art historical case studies. A final project integrates Geosciences and Art History topics to investigate the use of a chosen natural material in a specific work of art. Each material addressed in the course plays a crucial role in the history of art, and each one was particularly prized for its physical and material properties (color, hardness, etc.). Ochre was the first known pigment, and was in use by early humans for bodily adornment and for drawing and painting in caves and shelters as early as 100,000 years ago for bodily adornment and 40,0000 years ago in cave art. Its availability worldwide and in multiple strong colors made it a desirable choice. Lapis lazuli, by contrast, was difficult to obtain, and difficult to refine as a pigment. It was first used to make small sculptures and cylinder seals in the Ancient world, and was prized for its brilliant blue color. The difficulty in grinding and purifying blue pigment from lapis lazuli made it one of the most expensive pigments in the Medieval and Renaissance world--it was worth its weight in silver! Pure blue lapis pigment, when found in a painting, is always a sign of great expense and importance. Rock crystal was valued for its clarity and purity, and its extreme brittleness meant that works made from it were valued for their intricacy and fragility. Nero reportedly destroyed two elaborate crystal goblets in a rage, and in so doing, deprived future generations of masterpieces of the sculptor's art. In the Ancient Near East and Ancient Egypt, rock crystal was frequently used for amulets and other magical objects, while in the Medieval world, its purity was seen as a metaphor for the Virgin Mary. Garnet had a similar symbolic value in the Middle Ages: its red color was related to the blood of Christ, and it was thus used frequently in liturgical vessels. In the Ancient world, the rich red tone of garnets was prized in jewelry and in small-scale relief carvings. Igneous stones like porphyry, basalt and diorite were particularly prized for their extreme hardness and permanence, and thus the Law Code of Hammurabi was iinscribed on basalt to ensure its permanence. Other Ancient Near Eastern rulers had images of themselves made from basalt and diorite in order to ensure that those works would survive for centuries. Imperial porphyry, an igneous stone with a rich red-purple color, came from a single remote quarry in the Egyptian mountains. Its use was reserved just for the Imperial family in Rome, and it was used for carved sarcophagi, for columns, for colored veneers on floors and walls, etc., as a sign of Imperial authority. Marble is of course one of the most familiar of all art materials, used frequently for sculpture from the very beginnings of art production. The Greeks and Romans in particular took great pains to obtain different types of marbles with specific colors, veining patterns, etc., for use in both sculpture and architecture. Finally, alabaster is one of the easiest of all stones to work: it is so soft that one can make a mark simply with a fingernail! Its intricate banding and translucency made it a favorite material for thin-walled bowls and vases in the Ancient Near East, Ancient Egypt, and in the Classical world. Later, in Early Christian and Medieval Italy, it was used for windows instead of glass--sun shining through alabaster casts a golden glow into a church interior. By the Late Gothic period, alabaster was being exploited as an easily sculpted material throughout Europe, with major quarries and workshops in England (Nottingham), France, and Northern Spain.",3,3,Cross-listed with: ARTH 107NGeneral Education: Arts (GA)General Education:  Natural Sciences (GN)General Education -  Integrative: InterdomainGenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies

Whenever possible, we approach this subject historically. Among other topics, we examine the history of how earthquakes have been understood as well as the impact of earthquakes and seismicity on the history and development of certain societies. Our specific perspectives include: Earthquakes as understood by modern and contemporary earth science Major conceptions of earthquakes in the past Impacts of seismic hazards on the built environment of past societies Impacts of seismic hazards on politics, economic development and social policies of past societies Seismic hazards, earthquake-related technology, and contemporary societies By examining earthquakes in these ways, the study of earthquakes becomes a vehicle for enhancing skills in analytical reasoning. In particular, this course focusses on applications of modern scientific analysis and the approaches commonly employed in historical investigation. Specific skills addressed in this course include, processing and quantifying information, problem solving using evidence and sound reasoning, and expressing ideas with clarity. Immersion in the study of earthquakes affords an opportunity to think more broadly about how people have dealt with natural disasters in the past and to explore the roles that science, technology, and social policy play in defining and addressing natural hazards in contemporary societies and in the future. Class meetings include lectures, discussions, and in-class activities. We analyze scientific observations that have led to increased understanding of earthquakes, earthquake hazards and risk.

Students are exposed to a variety of analytical approaches from the arts, humanities and social sciences to allow them to see how different perspectives portray the world, interpret events, and often shape human actions. The course begins from a humanities perspective, exploring the concept of social identity, in particular understanding how people in different cultures develop a sense of their identity and how this is perpetuated over time through a society's products, practices, and perspectives (e.g. artifacts, value systems, traditions). The focus then shifts to organizations in society, comparing how they operate with either national or global identities. This leads to an exploration of how information and communication technologies are tools to create both global connectivity, yet can also be a source of division. Globalization is then considered in terms of its impact on the natural environment, populations, and health. Challenges arising in each of these areas are the concern of all global citizens, and are explored in terms of how interdependencies are increasing their impact. The focus of the course progresses to gender, poverty, and human rights, exploring these in tandem with their literary representations, presented in both global and comparative contexts. Economic development models are also used to uncover trends in gender and poverty. The final focus is on global peace and conflict, highlighting how globalization, in bringing people and nations closer together, can also give rise to conflict and division. This course is one of two 100-level courses that are required for the GLIS major.

4448,HIST 6N,HIST,6,N,History and Weather: How Weather Played an Instrumental Role in Great World Events,"In HIST 6N / METEO 6N, we'll survey how weather and history are integrated throughout time. Moving from past to present, the course will use case studies to navigate historical moments where weather shaped the outcome. Each case study will have a historical, cultural, and meteorological analysis of the event so students gain a deeper understanding of the national or international event and the integration of science and history. Weather has shaped the outcome of major world events. For example, a weather forecast led to the delay of the Allied invasion of Normandy (DDay), record cold weather in Florida led to the Challenger Space Shuttle explosion, General George Washington used fog to conceal the withdrawal of his troops at the Battle of Long Island, and the list goes on. The case studies range from the Revolutionary War through present day, and this period of history has been selected because there are firsthand accounts of the weather and/or recorded weather data for each event. The meteorological study examines the event's atmospheric conditions. How or why did they occur? How did they affect the event? Therefore, students will learn basic meteorology and climatology. They will also analyze weather maps and scientific data. The historical study provides context for the event. What lead to the event? What happened during the event? What are the event's lasting impacts? To better understand the decisions that leaders faced, students will be asked to assess risk and make decisions based on the same weather data or information leaders at the time had. Students will also explain the context, cause, and effects of major historical moments in everyday language to an audience of their peers through discussions and/or projects. The cultural study examines each event from a psychological and sociological point of view. What were the mindsets of the people and cultures involved in the event? How does the event connect to or parallel things in today's society? How would a present day culture react? This study will give students a better understanding of cultural differences in the world and how those cultural differences can alter the course of history. Time in the course is equally split between United States and international topics, and there will be frequent discussion of current events.",3,3,Cross-listed with: METEO 6NInternational Cultures (IL)United States Cultures (US)General Education: Humanities (GH)General Education:  Natural Sciences (GN)General Education -  Integrative: InterdomainGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking

4469,HIST 110,HIST,110,,Introduction to Global Environmental History,"This course provides a broad introduction to the history of human relationships with nature throughout the world. The human relationship with the natural environment the world of plants, animals, and microbes, of air, water, and land is an important historical subject. History 110 provides a broad, thematic description and analysis of major global trends and shifts, with an emphasis on contemporary issues and problem solving. The most important goal of the course is to provide students with the historical context necessary to construct a thoughtful appreciation of the environmental dilemmas of our time. Ecology has contributed a great deal to historical understanding in terms of specific examples or case studies; however, it has also begun to reconstruct the overall structure of the history that we teach. History 110 seeks to leverage this new paradigm by encouraging students to break down the barriers that often divide the humanities and the sciences. This course utilizes environmental science to demonstrate and explain specific human tendencies. Finally, this course is structured to help students better situate the history of the United States in a more global centered view of both the past and contemporary environmental concerns. Particularly in relation to contemporary environmental issues, History 110 will make clear that many environmental problems are local in neither their construction nor impact. The course will focus on several critical points, including: How has the non-human world shaped the course of human history? What were the environmental impacts of historic changes in the ways humans produced and consumed resources? What ideas shaped the ways different groups of people defined and used specific resources? What role have science and technology played in changing popular attitudes about the human place in the world?",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesInternational Cultures (IL)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies

4478,HIST 118,HIST,118,,Modern Jewish History,"Modern Jewish history is a complex and fascinating story. Some scholars depicted it as a long period of suffering and isolation that culminated in the Holocaust and only ended with the founding of the state of Israel. In recent decades a more balanced perspective has found wide acceptance. Today scholars highlight Jewish agency and different conditions in the various places Jews settled without downplaying anti-Jewish prejudice and violence. A recurring theme in this course concerns the relationship between individual Jews and Jewish communities, and on a broader level, the perception and treatment of Jews by societies and states. As Jews in Western and Central Europe ""left the Ghetto"" around 1800 and became citizens of states, they redefined their relationship to Jewish communities in strikingly different ways. Some Jewish women and men emerged as agents of change, others resisted change. We will explore Jewish ""responses to modernity,"" ranging from assimilation, Zionism, and socialism to migration. While many Jews in Western Europe and the United States prospered, the lives of Jews (and their neighbors) in Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empire were shaped by social and economic crisis (albeit not constantly and not everywhere). For the twentieth century the course will concentrate on three major events that had a dramatic impact on Jews, especially in Europe: the First World War and the collapse of the large multiethnic Empires in Eastern Europe, the Holocaust and the founding of the first modern Jewish state, Israel.",3,3,Cross-listed with: JST 118Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesInternational Cultures (IL)GenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning

Math will be examined as a cultural product, with specific developments contextualized in the generating civilization's history, socio-political structures, economic systems, artistic and literary movements, and prevailing religious and philosophical ideas. Students will investigate the ways in which specific aspects of a culture influenced the development of specific ideas about, approaches to, and techniques regarding number and mathematical processes. Key themes in this respect will be what social forces encourage the development of practical or theoretical mathematics; how a society determines what is truth; the conception of abstract ideas such as zero and negative, infinite, and irrational numbers; the social status of mathematicians and their relationship with political and social authorities; and what social forces hinder the development of practical and/or theoretical mathematics. Students will also consider how the availability of certain mathematical knowledge enabled the development of particular social systems, architectural achievements, and more. Key themes in this respect will be the mathematical needs of specific political systems (such as the accounting involved in imperial administration), legal systems (such as fair division of goods), and religious systems (such as the calculation of accurate systems of time). At the same time, students will draw connections across time periods and cultures by examining the interactions between civilizations and how those interactions influenced the development of mathematics as a human endeavor. Key themes in this respect will be understanding what political, economic, and other forces cause cultures to come into contact or seek out contact; and how the exchange of knowledge shapes both the receiving culture and the study of mathematics as a whole. As part of this course, students will study both specific mathematical ideas (e.g., number systems, deductive reasoning, geometric algebra, and the motivating problems that spurred development) and the specific ancient and medieval cultures named above.",3,3,International Cultures (IL)General Education: Humanities (GH)General Education:  Natural Sciences (GN)General Education -  Integrative: InterdomainGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking

While ""knowing the facts"" is obviously important to historical understanding, this course helps students develop critical thinking skills. These skills include: close and thoughtful reading and analysis of primary and secondary sources; looking for a broader coherence or ""order"" to the material; independent analysis and effective articulation (both in writing and in class discussion) of well-reasoned, well-crafted conclusions and interpretations and arguments (conclusions/interpretations/arguments which are supported by specific factual evidence derived from a variety of sources). The three specific course objectives underscore its scholarly dimensions: (1) Students will gain a knowledge and understanding of the diverse experiences of different groups of Native people. (2) Students will gain an understanding and knowledge of the political, economic, and social processes that shaped Native American history. (3) Students will learn how to ""think historically"" by placing documents written in the past in their historical contexts, and to consider the relationship of the past to the present. By the end of the course students will: Demonstrate an understanding of the chronology of Native America history. Demonstrate an understanding of the diverse experiences of different groups of Native peoples. Demonstrate an understanding of the social, political, and ideological structures that shaped the history of Native peoples and continue to shape the modern United States.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesUnited States Cultures (US)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies

4556,HIST 220,HIST,220,,Global Diaspora and Exile,"Introduction to and survey of the Jewish and other Diasporas around the world.  HIST (J ST) 220 The Jewish and Other Diasporas (3) (GH;IL) The long dominant view that the Jewish experience since antiquity defines Diaspora as a concept has been challenged in recent years. The meaning of the term Diaspora and related terms, especially (ethnic and/or national) identity and (ethnic and/or national) community, is a matter of much debate across disciplines. The longevity and diversity of distinct Jewish communities around the globe make the Jewish case a particularly interesting subject for study. In a wide geographical, chronological and disciplinary comparative sweep, the course will explore the diverse nature of ethno-national and ethno-religious diasporas (and sub-diasporas), their position, their place of origin (""homeland"") and their new surrounding culture and society. More specifically, the course will analyze how Diaspora communities in Europe, Asia, and the Atlantic world reconstituted their identities as they expanded into new environments and encountered other cultures, from antiquity to the present. Emphasis will be placed on exploration of the intersection of politics and culture in respect to race, nationality, ethnicity, gender and class. A key question guiding the discussions will relate to the usefulness and limitations of the Diaspora concept, especially in regard to the discourse about globalization where the term is often used. The course will begin with an extensive discussion of theoretical texts about the Diaspora phenomenon. This is followed by case studies of several larger Diasporas, ranging from the Jewish, the Greek to the Chinese Diaspora. Several case studies, notably the Muslim Diaspora, the concept of a victim Diaspora, or alternative Diasporas highlight the limitations of the Diaspora concept. The course introduces students to interdisciplinary approaches, placing some emphasis on the use of theoretical texts written by historians, sociologists, political scientists, and anthropologists. The course includes a one-day field trip to the Lower Eastside in New York (visit of the Museum of Chinese in America, walking tour of the Lower Eastside to explore the history of a key American immigrant neighborhood).",3,3,Cross-listed with: JST 220International Cultures (IL)General Education: Humanities (GH)

HIST (J ST) 261Y Ghetto: From Venice to Detroit (3) (GH;US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course examines the history of segregated and demarcated districts for certain groups of people within cities (and metropolitan regions) in the last five hundred years in different parts of the world. The course identifies factors that led to the establishment of segregated (and often demarcated) districts -and their eventual dissolution (or transformation). The course traces the social and political impact of exclusion within the segregated district, the possibilities of making contacts beyond the district, the function of innovation and cultural production emanating from these urban areas, and the conceptual trajectory of the Ghetto concept from Renaissance Venice to post-industrial Detroit. Cities and states have allowed certain groups to settle within their confines for economic benefit but have imposed severe restrictions to safeguard the respective city's and/or the state's cultural, political, and ""racial"" integrity. The course will present several representative case studies of segregated and demarcated districts in European, North American, Asian and African cities, highlighting strikingly different trajectories and purposes behind the spatial segregation of people categorized as different and threatening but also as useful. Comparing the case studies will lead to a discussion about the transformation of the Ghetto concept between 1517 and the present. Following a discussion of the Ghetto concept and an overview of urban history since 1500 we will study Jewish Ghettos in early and late Renaissance Italy and Central Europe. For comparison we will discuss the history of Dutch and Portuguese trade colonies in Japan around 1600. The second part of the course will focus on Jewish and other immigrant neighborhoods in late 19th century New York and Chicago. Before moving to the origins of the 20th century ""Black Ghetto"" (Chicago, Detroit) four related cases will be discussed: Chinatowns in the United States; residential segregation in colonial cities in South and East Asia, Nazi Ghettos in Poland and the Soviet Union; and townships in South Africa during the Apartheid period. The course introduces students to interdisciplinary approaches, placing some emphasis on the use of theoretical texts written by historians, sociologists, political scientists, and anthropologists.",3,3,Cross-listed with: JST 261YBachelor of Arts: HumanitiesInternational Cultures (IL)United States Cultures (US)General Education: Humanities (GH)Writing Across the Curriculum

It seeks to understand what these episodes have in common and what is unique in each case--is there a single universal, eternal antisemitism?

HIST (J ST/RL ST) 424H (PHIL 434H) Monotheism and the Birth of the West (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Learn about the formation of Western culture while learning to analyze the texts and other evidence about its formation from a critical rather than naive viewpoint. The idea of monotheism probably arose very early, and was even briefly implemented as a state cultic policy in Egypt in the 14th century BCE. Why then did it take another seven centuries to become widespread--appearing in ancient Judah, Babylon and Ionia almost simultaneously? To answer this question, the course focuses on several developments through the medium of primary texts and archaeology: the shift from a state hinterland based in extensive agriculture and household processing to one organized for intensive agriculture and industrial processing the rise of recognizably modern science; the promotion of individuation and an international elite culture in the context of Assyrian and Babylonian imperial ambitions; the development of the historical and archaeological arts in the context of archaizing in order to re-invent local traditions; and the socialization of monotheism and of democracy. Students will be evaluated on their discussion of the textual evidence as well as on reports in class and a final paper. This is the sole honors course treating the birth of the West.

Is it possible that the ghetto, the camp, and the forest look different from women's perspectives? Are there factors we miss when we read primary documents written by only half of the participants in these historical events?

4643,HIST 474,HIST,474,,Early Modern Japan,"Japanese history from 1580-1880.  ASIA 474 (HIST 474, JAPNS 426) Early Modern Japan (3) Japan's Tokugawa period can be difficult to grasp. It resembles a modern society in many respects but operated according to a logic of social organization different from that of most modern states. There was a collective sense of national identity, but its characteristics differed significantly from modern forms of Japanese identity. Moreover, modern ideologies have contributed to the characterization of early modern Japan as a rigid society and of the country as a whole having been isolated from the rest of the world. The main purpose of this course is to afford students the opportunity to study early modern Japan in detail and, insofar as possible, on its own terms. Through readings in primary and secondary sources, and through the evaluation of visual images, this seminar-style course will deepen students' knowledge of Japan and serve as basis for comparative study of other early modern societies. Although the course investigates classic areas of historical study such as institutional development and foreign relations, the emphasis is on social and environmental history. The course encourages students to think about a range of approaches to the past and to think about the ways our contemporary biases influence the ways we understand the past.",3,3,"Prerequisite:  HIST 172 , HIST 174 , JAPNS120 or JAPNS121"

ASIA (HIST) 481 Modern Japan Since 1800 (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. In the late 19th century, Japan emerged from relative seclusion and grew, within the period of a few decades, into one of the world's major powers. Japan's remarkable transformation into an imperialist power ended suddenly with defeat by the Allied powers in August 1945. But the history of prewar and wartime Japanese nation-building and economic growth set the stage for postwar rebuilding. This course examines Japan's development as a powerful modern state, imperialist aggressor, defeated nation, economic power-house, and pop culture super-power. Specific content will vary according to individual instructor, but may include the structures of state and society in the early 19th century, the creation of the Meiji state (1868-1912), the successes and costs of the Meiji government's program of rapid modernization and Westernization, imperialist expansion, the road to war and defeat in World War II, the postwar U.S. occupation of Japan (1945-1952), Japan's resurgence as a global power, and some of the major challenges facing the Japanese state and society today. The goals of the class are not only to gain an understanding of the history of another country, but also to develop the skill of building such an understanding through primary and secondary sources, both written and visual. Students in this class will take on the role of historian themselves, thinking critically about assigned texts and making their own interpretations of their meanings.

Issues of social justice and equity play an integral role in defining the questions that Human Development and Family Studies students ask and the solutions that they pursue, as students must account for diverse needs and values based on age, gender, ethnicity and cultural background. Students preparing to work in the field of Human Development and Family Studies must possess the content, pedagogical and professional knowledge, skills, and dispositions necessary to work in diverse communities. HDFS 345 is an opportunity for students to explore the relationship between contemporary urban issues and family development. Participants will evaluate urban development from a Human Development perspective and with a critical eye to how urban development has accounted for the distinctive needs of different segments of the public. Therefore, HDFS 345 incorporates the knowledge of different Human Development and Family Studies theories and social justice paradigms to help students examine urban themes and build their understanding of social justice and family development as related to these themes. Students will learn how urban planning accounts for differences in society, identify different segments of the urban population differentiated by a few diversity constructs (culture, race, SES, gender, etc) and gain awareness of the varying and distinctive needs and concerns of these groups with respect to living in the urban environment. Students will also explore contemporary issues, like modern policing practices, and find resources to develop solutions to social issues or problems. Discussions of policy and moral philosophy will contribute to students' aptitude to plan an appropriate solution with tangible results.

HDFS 400 is a community engaged and culture of support course. Community engagement, also called service learning, is a form of reciprocal experiential education wherein students learn through the collaborative process of meeting authentic community needs. High quality community engagement also attempts to affect real, material social conditions; to authentically integrate the work done to meet community needs with the curriculum/course through continuous, critical reflexive and reflective inquiry; and to be a system of praxis (theory - practice) where the inquiry then informs the work participants do, participants' self-concepts, and the practices of the community.

Students will gain an understanding of how policies are shaped by both facts and myths, as well as our values. Students will examine historical and current trends in family patterns (e.g., divorce, women's labor force participation, nonmarital births) to understand the implications they hold for individuals, families and society. Students will gain an awareness of the social, economic, historical, legal, and political contexts within which family policies exist and are proposed. Although the main focus is on U.S. family policy, some time will be devoted to learning about family policies in other countries. We will learn about several specific family policies in-depth (e.g., welfare), but a final goal is to help students develop a general way of looking at family policy that they can then use to understand any issue of family policy that unfolds throughout their lifetime. This course will foster thoughtful reflection and critical thinking, writing skills, research skills, and skills of synthesis, logic, and argument. Course goals will be accomplished through course readings, writing assignments, lectures, class discussions, debates and group projects.

ENGR 426ENGR (MGMT/IST/ENTR) 426 Invention Commercialization (3) The goal of ENGR (MGMT/IST/ENTR) 426 is to have students understand why invention commercialization is complicated and difficult by participating in the process. For example, the inventor rarely has insights into the markets for his/her invention, is often not interested in the details of commercialization, and can be secretive. In addition, the business and financial communities often do not take the time, or have the resources, to understand new technologies and perform complex due diligence. Thus lack of due diligence often leads to rejection of innovation because existing companies often discount new technologies from outside the company as NIH - 'not invented here'. Effective transfer of new invention or innovation to a commercial product requires at least three different functional communities to interface: technical, legal and business. Each uses a different language, comes from different educational and cultural backgrounds, and may have an inherent distrust of the others. These functional barriers are difficult to overcome.This course teaches how these barriers can be broken down as student teams help bridge the perceived chasm between key players in the invention commercialization process. In these teams, students bring the skills and knowledge from their major to develop an invention commercialization recommendation for the Technology Transfer Office and the inventor. For example, business students focus on finance and market opportunity assessment; engineering and IST students focus on design refinements, prototyping support, and (if appropriate) making technology suggestions to the inventor.Upon completing the course, the students will have a working knowledge of different university and corporate technology or invention commercialization processes, important intellectual property management tools for inventions (patents, license agreements, option agreements) source of funding to move inventions toward product development, and delivering top quality presentations which outline the recommended commercialization path.

Professional security protection could satisfy reasonable assurance criteria by managing legal and regulatory risks based on commonly-held understandings of burglary, theft, conversion and widely-understood but related institutional constraints in the protection of physical property. This focus retained effectiveness so long as physical security over tangible property appeared successful, even extending to the maintenance of control over mainframe computers and their peripherals. However, the proliferation of networked computers has made access and storage ubiquitous, vastly increasing the vulnerability of confidential data, private information and critical national security infrastructure. Security and privacy regulation compliance responsibility now falls much more harshly on both organizations and most of their individual personnel. These complex new duties constrain organizations in the data management industry as well as suppliers and users of data and all participants in the information supply chain, including consultants, software suppliers, applications service providers, maintenance, outsourcing and communications providers.Other factors exacerbate these liability risk management difficulties. Advances in network computer storage and use, the broadening perception of heightened value of information and the pervasive availability of rich data warehousing increase the vulnerability of data management. Risks of information theft and integrity losses as well as the explosion of privacy rights and national security concerns now require pervasive and fuller understanding of liability risk management principles/techniques among all managers and subordinates in the data management industry and in government. Information suppliers, handlers, owners and network service providers are increasingly exposed to civil litigation, regulatory oversight/compliance and criminal prosecution for various information-related wrongs. For example, confidentiality is compulsory for corporate trade secrets, privacy is required for personally identifiable information about individuals and secrecy is mandatory over matters of national security; all of which create complex legal duties that are fundamentally driving the design of information handling processes. This course surveys legal and regulatory constraints on information security and privacy practices.",3,3,Enforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: IST 432

5060,INART 55,INART,55,,History of Electroacoustic Music,"A history of electroacoustic music as a consequence of developments in culture and technology from 1880 to present. INART 55 History of Electroacoustic Music (3) (GA)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course focuses on the interrelationship and parallel development of technology, art and music from the earliest electronic devices to the current ubiquitous computer audio workstation and electronics dance music.Electronica is a multi-faceted genre that borrows from a number of past innovators. Its artists routinely acknowledge the influence, for example, ofmusique concrete , Karlheinz Stockhausen and the theremin, yet their audiences are often unaware of the roots of the music that occupies much of their recreational time and social energy.Electroacoustic music developed hand in hand with innovations in communications technology, which in turn influenced the way music was conceived and created. Too often, these correlations are not discussed. Both electrical engineers and musicians use filters, without necessarily realizing that they are both using the same technology for different purposes. FM synthesis revolutionized commercial electronic instruments in the 1980s, yet few people realize that this was the same form of modulation that was the basis of much radio broadcast technology. Many innovators in electronic music started out as inventors or engineers. The creation of electroacoustic music is one of the most fertile cross-disciplinary fields of the twentieth (and now twenty-first) centuries. It has affected the production and reception of music indelibly, and is now a vital component of digital multi-media art, a leading trend of the new century.The course asks students to be aware of vital technological developments in audio (the evolution from the Edison phonograph to the CD player), electronics (the evolution from the spark gap oscillator to the vacuum tube to the transistor to the microprocessor), cultural movements (from Impressionism and Romanticism to modernism to postmodernism), and to become sensitized to the chief innovators in the field (the differences in the music of Schaffer, Stockhausen, Carlos, Chowning, and others). They are made aware not only of names and terms, but also taught to recognize differences in the different sounds of different composers and styles.The course has been offered two semesters as a 297 offering. It is designed so that it may eventually be offered completely online. The text is online, and the listening assignments are also posted at the PSU Digital Music Library.Grading will be based on weekly quizzes that ask for definitions and short answers, four tests that require essays and identification of listening examples, and two papers focused on different compositions/composers.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: ArtsGeneral Education: Arts (GA)

INART 110 Dramatic Arts in the Mass Media (3) (GA)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. INART 110 examines the history and development of the dramatic arts of the mass media with a particular focus on television as the strongest exemplar of media practice. The primary goal of the course is to help students develop a critical and analytical approach to dealing with the dramatic arts of the contemporary mass media. The course presupposes some familiarity with modern popular media and takes as its content both historical and contemporary examples as sources for analysis. While the class offers facts and data, the central focus of the course in the theory, stylistic elements, and structural workings of media content. The pedagogical goal of this approach is to examine not just what the mass media arts are but also where they come from, how they function, and what effects they have on our culture and society. The key to this goal is understanding the effects and influence of dramas in the mass media on our society and its beliefs and values. Class meetings consist of lectures and in-class discussions that illustrate modern critical approaches to popular culture and the terminology used in presenting critical arguments and ideological viewpoints on the dramatic arts of the mass media. Reading assignments will support classroom work by presenting students with a diversity of opinion on mass media and the influence of television dramas and comedies. Further, examples of historically significant radio and television dramatic works will be shown in class and then discussed in relation to the concepts and critical viewpoints covered in lectures. In addition to regular scheduled classes, students will participate in an on-line Television Journal that requires watching and critically responding to assigned television programs. Each week, students will be required to watch and critically respond to assigned television programs. Their critical responses will be posted on the online Television Journal and made available to all members of the class. Grades will be based on three equally weighted objective examinations that will account for 75% of the semester grade.

Japan provides one key example through which to observe the use and function of art to create not only the image and identity of a nation and national culture, but also the image and identity of other national cultures. In recent years, Japanese popular culture has been reborn around the world. A global generation has grown up watching anime and reading manga in Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and English. Beyond Anime is designed to contextualize the recent appropriation and dissemination of Japanese popular culture through the cyclical history of such appropriations through the modern period. In this way, the course will explore the precursors, antecedents, and contexts to our present cultural moment. Through film, photography, posters, matchbook-labels, textiles, industrial design, novels, and myriad other popular media, this seminar-style study of Japanese popular visual culture will help students see Japanese visual arts in terms that are local to Japanese aesthetics and through those that transcend local cultures.

This course introduces students to the literature of ancient Israel, its rituals, the stories which established a people's identity, and which defined their moral behavior. Great figures of the texts, such as Moses, David, Solomon, Bathsheba, Ruth, Jeremiah, Daniel, and Ezra, teach us important lessons about life and how people of faith attempted to relate to one another, to God, and to people outside their ethnic group.

CMLIT 113 / JST 113 / CAMS 113 / RLST 113 Myths and Legends of the Jews (3) (GH;IL) The impact of the Bible on Western Culture is immense. Beyond its religious importance, the motifs and images from its myths and stories permeate literature and art, providing a basic frame of reference that for much of history could be taken for granted. A degree of familiarity with these motifs so as to be truly fluent is no longer common, and so it requires special effort to discern allusions to biblical traditions. Moreover, these traditions are not static: religious communities continually re-interpret them and appropriate them in very different contexts. Many prominent traditions in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam do not appear explicitly anywhere in the Hebrew Bible, but are the product of imaginative and ingenious interpretation and re-tellings. Why, for example, is Noah an example of a righteous person in Christian tradition, but in rabbinic tradition is more often portrayed as a profane, earthly-minded man who was saved only because he was the least bad of an evil generation? Why is Moses commonly portrayed with horns in medieval art? Underlying such different traditions are centuries of debate and reflection on these texts as sacred scripture, and competing religious communities often authorized their distinctive beliefs and practices by reading them into scripture. The differences are often too subtle to discern apart from careful comparison. This course will explore the boundaries between Scripture and tradition by means of a close examination of the myths and stories in the Hebrew Bible and their subsequent interpretation and re-tellings in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Using methods from comparative mythology and folklore, as well as comparative midrash, our procedure will be to compare these traditions closely with the biblical text, asking: What are the main motifs in the mythology of Judaism? Does Judaism have a coherent mythology? How do their myths compare with the myths of their neighbors? Where did these myths come from? How do these traditions relate to the Bible? What was the function of these myths? Why are there competing myths? How is it possible that Judaism affirms belief in only one God, but has myths that include other divine beings? We will also compare with later interpretive traditions (Jewish, Christian, Islamic). Can we trace trajectories of interpretation? Can we discern particular interpretive methods in operation? We will seek to answer: what do these re-workings of the traditions tell us about the development and function of Scripture, and the social circumstances of the communities? Finally, we will seek to detect reflections of these interpretive traditions in literature and art from the medieval to the modern periods. The course is organized around major topics in the Jewish Scriptures: God, creation, heaven and hell, Torah, Sabbath, Abraham and other ancestors, Israel and holy land, exile, and Messiah. Throughout we will consider how sacred stories function to form ethical perspectives and values.",3,3,"Cross-listed with: CAMS 113, CMLIT 113, RLST 113Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesBachelor of Arts: Other CulturesInternational Cultures (IL)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key LiteraciesGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason"

In form and structure, the course is historical, following figures and events in a more or less chronological sequence and taking up questions of causality, influence, and social identity. Yet the course is also concerned with the ideas, concepts, and philosophical viewpoints that have shaped Christianity and given it a certain intellectual coherence over time. The course begins with first-century construals of messianic identity and also with the figure of Jesus, as he was portrayed in the New Testament gospels. It then follows the first generations of the Christian movement, considering it within the context of first-century Judaism and the early Roman empire. Topics include persecution, martyrdom, and the important contributions of Origen. The middle section of the course looks at the second, third, and fourth centuries through three lenses, as it were: the office of bishop, the rise of monasticism, and the realities of empire. Bishops, monks, and emperors all shaped Christianity in essential ways, creating a rich and complicated spiritual, moral, theological, intellectual, and geo-political legacy for generations to come. The final third of the course looks at the development of Christianity beyond the fourth century in geographical groupings including churches in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, western Europe, Byzantium, and the Slavic lands. It is hoped, in all of this, that students will gain an understanding not only of Christian history but also of what made - and what makes - Christianity a distinctive and influential religion.",3,3,"Cross-listed with: CAMS 124, RLST 124Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesInternational Cultures (IL)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies"
5264,JST 132,JST,132,,Jewish American Literature,"This course will provide an introduction to Jewish American literature through a historical survey of the tradition's key texts, figures, and themes. The course will focus on the defining aspects of the literature and on what the literature ""thinks"" about Jewish American culture and identity. But rather than assuming a unity to Jewish-American culture, this course will use Jewish literature to seek ways of articulating and representing both the points of cohesion and the points of divergence that characterize Jewish life in America. The United States has absorbed large numbers of Jewish immigrants hailing from many parts of the world, holding many different ideas about Jewish practice, and affiliating themselves with many different political, social, and cultural traditions. Moreover, Jews have settled and made homes in a wide variety of American communities. This course aims to explore Jewish American culture's marked diversity by offering a literary window onto the major fault-lines running through Jewish American culture: lines demarcated by gender, by political affiliation, by geography, by pre-immigration community by religious practice, by attitude toward world Jewry, by national allegiance, and by minhag (or custom), to name just a few. The class therefore provides an opportunity to consider the constitution, origin, and development of Jewish American's identity and social formations by looking at how that identity and those social formations exist and what they ""do"" in literature written by and about Jews in America. Materials will consist predominantly of primary texts, including prose fiction and nonfiction, poetry, drama, and film. Course methodology will emphasize the close reading of these texts. The course complements offerings in Jewish Studies and English, and it will satisfy the GH and US requirements. Most obviously, the course will offer students of Jewish literature, world literature, and American literature an opportunity for contextualization. It enables students in Jewish Studies to study the rich literature of American Jews, and it adds to courses covering Jewish American history, religion, and culture.

HIST (J ST) 220 The Jewish and Other Diasporas (3) (GH;IL) The long dominant view that the Jewish experience since antiquity defines Diaspora as a concept has been challenged in recent years. The meaning of the term Diaspora and related terms, especially (ethnic and/or national) identity and (ethnic and/or national) community, is a matter of much debate across disciplines. The longevity and diversity of distinct Jewish communities around the globe make the Jewish case a particularly interesting subject for study. In a wide geographical, chronological and disciplinary comparative sweep, the course will explore the diverse nature of ethno-national and ethno-religious diasporas (and sub-diasporas), their position, their place of origin (""homeland"") and their new surrounding culture and society. More specifically, the course will analyze how Diaspora communities in Europe, Asia, and the Atlantic world reconstituted their identities as they expanded into new environments and encountered other cultures, from antiquity to the present. Emphasis will be placed on exploration of the intersection of politics and culture in respect to race, nationality, ethnicity, gender and class. A key question guiding the discussions will relate to the usefulness and limitations of the Diaspora concept, especially in regard to the discourse about globalization where the term is often used. The course will begin with an extensive discussion of theoretical texts about the Diaspora phenomenon. This is followed by case studies of several larger Diasporas, ranging from the Jewish, the Greek to the Chinese Diaspora. Several case studies, notably the Muslim Diaspora, the concept of a victim Diaspora, or alternative Diasporas highlight the limitations of the Diaspora concept. The course introduces students to interdisciplinary approaches, placing some emphasis on the use of theoretical texts written by historians, sociologists, political scientists, and anthropologists. The course includes a one-day field trip to the Lower Eastside in New York (visit of the Museum of Chinese in America, walking tour of the Lower Eastside to explore the history of a key American immigrant neighborhood).",3,3,Cross-listed with: HIST 220International Cultures (IL)General Education: Humanities (GH)

JST 405 / RLST 405 Jews and Food (3) (IL) This course examines Jewish laws, customs and attitudes with regard to food production, agricultural policy and eating from biblical to modern times. These tenets of the Jewish tradition presently underwrite modern movements concerned with land use and food sustainability, as well as ethical behaviors in food production. The goal of the course is to understand how Jewish tradition can inform and contribute to improvements in the modern food system.The starting point is the ancient world of the Israelites,. Students will study agrarian interpretations of the Hebrew Bible as well as extra-biblical sources and archaeological data. The biblical attitudes toward food, eating, and agricultural practices are then traced into the post-biblical period and rabbinic periods. The course then jumps ahead to the present day, to shed light on a number of modern Jewish agricultural and food initiatives concerned with issues such as healthy land use, sustainability, and justice in food production and distribution. These movements proceed from various interpretations of Jewish law and custom, and illustrate how some modern Jewish attitudes toward food and eating are responsible for reimagining, and in some cases reinvigorating, biblical ideas and practices.At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to identify and understand the historical and theological significance of diet and eating practices of ancient Israelites and will understand the development of Jewish food laws and practices in the post-exilic and early rabbinic eras. Students will be able to evaluate the extent to which ancient Jewish thought has influenced modern Jewish attitudes and actions regarding food and social responsibility, and will be able to envision the ways in which Jewish tradition, both ancient and modern, can contribute to current progress and future improvement in our systems of food production, distribution and consumption. While a wide variety of derivative topics will be discussed, this course is particularly appropriate for students pursuing programs of study dealing with the biblical world, the development of early Judaism, Jewish ethics, and/or modern Jewish thought, as well as those studying agriculture and food systems who are interested in how Jewish tradition addresses these universal concerns.",3,3,Prerequisite: Third semester standing

The idea of monotheism probably arose very early and was even briefly implemented as a state cultic policy in Egypt in the 14th century BCE. Why, then, did it take another seven centuries to become widespread--appearing in ancient Judah, Babylon, and Ionia almost simultaneously? To answer this question, the course focuses on several developments, through the medium of primary texts and archaeology: the shift from a state hinterland based in extensive agriculture and household processing to one organized for intensive agriculture and industrial processing the rise of recognizably modern science; the promotion of individuation and an international elite culture in the context of Assyrian and Babylonian imperial ambitions; the development of the historical and archaeological arts in the context of archaizing in order to reinvent local traditions; and the socialization of monotheism and of democracy. Students will be evaluated on their discussion of the textual evidence as well as on reports in class and a final paper. This is the sole honors course treating the birth of the West.

Course topics will include the history of ethical theory, the nature and problem of evil, goodness and suffering, witnessing and testimony, and the promise of an ethics. In addition, recent approaches to trauma theory and rights discourse will also be introduced, with some emphasis on how post-Holocaust ethics have been utilized in contemporary human rights work. This course provides students with philosophical approaches to the issues that emerge out of the events of the Holocaust. The course will help students expand their knowledge of the events of the Holocaust through a philosophical approach that does not merely expose them to what happened, but asks them to think about the implications of what happened: most specifically, how do we understand ethical life, if it cannot stop or confront evil? The course will encourage students to think critically, write effectively and express their thoughts logically. Student evaluation will be based on both regular writing assignments and in-class work, possibly including presentations and group-work.

5441,KINES 430W,KINES,430,W,Groups in Physical Activity,"During involvement in this course, students will be acquainted with how exercisers and athletes interact with the others within small group environments. Notably, athletes and exercisers are commonly structured into tight-knit, interactive, and interdependent groups such as teams, fitness classes, family units, peer groups, neighborhoods, and training groups. These small groups are fundamental to sport and exercise experiences, while also influencing whether or not youth and adults derive value from physical activity. Therefore, identifying and promoting optimal small group environments is a central goal for researchers studying the social psychology of sport. Whereas the construct of group cohesion is the most widely-studied aspect of small groups in this context, rich and emerging lines of research reveal a great deal about group structures (e.g., norms), emergent states (e.g., social identities), and group processes (e.g., teamwork), as well as the outcomes of involvement in groups. This area of research is of general theoretical interest, but is also critical to establish an enhanced practical understanding for fields ranging from coaching to health promotion, education, and psychology. To explore these group processes, the goal of the course entails establishing a foundational understanding of small group dynamics. From this foundation, class members will explore contemporary research and theory about optimizing sport groups (i.e., sport adherence and performance) and physical activity groups (i.e., physical activity maintenance, positive psychosocial perceptions). This exploration will demand that students read and discuss empirical research - demonstrating the capacity to interpret and understand this literature, along with the capacity to critically appraise empirical findings. Students' learning related to group dynamics will be cemented through discussions and activities focused on real-life groups, as well as demonstrations of group processes using group tasks. By the completion of the course, students will have acquired strategies to optimize small group environments and developed skills to communicate group dynamics constructs and theories. Regarding communication, a critical outcome of this writing-intensive course is the capacity to interpret writing from group dynamics experts and communicating these themes through one's own effective writing.",3,3,Writing Across the Curriculum

LARCH 235 Design Implementation I: Grading (2) As an introductory design implementation course, this course provides the foundation for site design in landscape architecture. At the core of the course are four general bodies of knowledge: Geometrics, Landform Manipulation, Site Systems, and Computer Applications for Site Analysis and Design.Geometrics: In order to perform landform manipulation, students must be able to efficiently acquire and process basic physical information about a site and are required to understand a suite of measurements. This course will first provide an overview of the digital and paper data sources available to landscape architects. Students will develop basic skills in manipulating or processing these data in order to comply with the requirements of site design. The course will also provide the basic measurements and formulae required for students to efficiently and accurately manipulate landforms.Landform Manipulation: One of the most critical skills landscape architects must acquire as designers is the ability to design landforms to accommodate changes in use and to translate their design ideas into dimensionally precise topographic representations of their designs. This course provides the basic knowledge for students to complete this process. Beginning with a single site element, students are expected to explore the suite of opportunities to place and modify a site to fit a single site element. Increased complexity is added to the suite throughout the remaining portions of the semester, thus enabling students to balance the opportunities and constraints presented by each individual design element and the overall site design.Site Systems: Building on ecological components of the curriculum, this course provides the first site specific and physical understanding of basic site systems critical to every landscape architect's design. Students will primarily focus on the major site features as related to site drainage, such as soil, topography, and surface geology, but will also be expected to recognize regional context in their designs.Computer Applications for Site Analysis and Design: A central component underlying the instruction of the course is providing students with a suite of computer tools.Course objectives: a) To assist in initial efforts in acquiring and processing site data; b) To perform calculations such as cut and fill, spot elevations, and slope calculations; c) To visualize and complete basic manipulation of landforms; d) To understand the interaction of physical site features on individual sites (e.g., soil and topography); and e) To communicate their final site designs according to professional standards",3,3,Prerequisite: LARCH 156 Concurrents: LARCH 255

It comprises a series of four one-day trips to select locations across our local Ridge & Valley landform region (Appalachian Mountain section), providing the opportunity to examine phenomena at the site level, particularly plants, soils, and landscape contexts. The field experience is immediately preceded by a few skills-building preparatory activities (e.g. workshop(s), test) to establish basic competencies and fore-knowledge. An essential tenet of the course is that layered and interconnected landscape systems learning is something all landscape architects should pursue in their region of practice. Every place possesses a particular relationship between the underlying geology, climate, hydrology, landform, soils, and the plants and animals that inhabit it. Understanding this relationship and learning how to analyze and interpret landscapes is important to all spatial design work-as a source of essential information and as a source of design inspiration. The Ridge & Valley region contains an especially clear, distinct and ""readable"" relationship between the geophysical and the biological-between the geological underpinnings and the plants and animals that inhabit the surface. This makes the Ridge & Valley an outstanding context to learn how to observe these important, sometimes subtle, relationships.

By the end of this course, students will be able to (a) Articulate a working definition of adolescent/YA literature; (b) Respond to a variety of YA literature texts individually and in a group to increase understanding, appreciation, and enjoyment of this literary genre; (c) Describe some of the trends and dominant concerns in the field of YA literature, including: multiculturalism, new/digital literacies, critical literacy, and censorship; (d) Choose YA texts appropriate for classroom use by gaining familiarity with a range of popular and/or award-winning YA literature titles; (e) Select YA texts that will stimulate interest, foster appreciation for the written word, and increase motivation of learners to read independently for pleasure and for personal growth; (e) Make and support claims about the use of YA lit in the ELA classroom; (f) Design lessons in the context of a reader's workshop approach; (g) Explore, evaluate, and select instructional materials and professional resources for teaching with YA literature; and (h) Demonstrate an awareness of culturally responsive literature teaching and an understanding of how cultural, linguistic, and ethnic diversity impact teaching and learning as these ideas connect to YA literature. This course engages essential questions in the teaching of young adult literature in the workshop format. First, it invites students to engage the question ""What is young adult literature (YA literature) or adolescent literature?"" This is particularly important as the YA category grows in quantity and importance. Second, students consider, ""How can we use YA literature to teach for social justice and social responsibility?,"" a question resonant with Standard Six of the National Council of Teachers of English's Standards for the Preparation of Teachers of English Language Arts. Students will consider in depth the advantages and the challenges of using YA literature in secondary classrooms. They will learn promising practices in adolescent literacy and teaching young adult literature as well as methods and materials that teachers can use to maximize engagement for all students. Finally, students will engage the linked questions of ""How can ELA teachers motivate students to read for pleasure and personal growth?"" and ""How do we humanize our YA literature teaching and teach for love, justice, joy, and wisdom?",3,3,Prerequisites: LLED 420; LLED 520
5630,LLED 462,LLED,462,,The Art of the Picturebook,"An in-depth study of picturebooks as art objects providing aesthetic experiences and contributing to our aesthetic development in literacy education.  LL ED 462 The Art of the Picturebook (3)The Art of the Picturebook explores a wide range of picturebooks with the idea that illustrations are visual art evoking thoughts and feelings. Because picturebooks provide aesthetic experiences and contribute to aesthetic development, they are rich and important sources for literacy education. This course provides opportunities to extend students' repertoire of strategies for making sense of picturebooks, to deepen knowledge about picturebooks and the artists who create them, and to consider ways to help children become more sophisticated readers of picturebooks. While picturebooks are often emphasized as integral to the literacy development of young children, they can be engaging and desirable for older children as well. Course topics include picturebooks for the very young, as well as picturebooks that could appeal to elementary and middle school children. Whether picturebooks appear relatively simple and straightforward or contain innovatively complex or metafictive design elements, close readings of them with an understanding of terminology offer opportunities to express and discuss reactions and interpretations. The Art of the Picturebook provides students a forum for exploring preferences, ideas, insights, and questions about selected picturebooks, along with curricular and pedagogical considerations. Course readings include interviews with illustrators, selections about creating picture compositions, and scholarly essays presenting theoretical perspectives and ideas about picturebooks as literature and art for children's literacy development. This course emphasizes that reading and interpreting picturebooks is an active, creative process that is socially, culturally, and historically situated. Authors and illustrators are influenced by culture, so their art reflects values of that culture, consciously or unconsciously. A reader's experience with a picturebook is also influenced by cultural and social contexts in a given moment. Because engaging in aesthetic experiences is an active, creative process, reading picturebooks is, as Jane Doonan (1993), author of Looking at Pictures in Picture Books, asserts, a form of play. The Art of the Picturebook approaches picturebooks as sources of deep play. The course also provides opportunities to research selected illustrators, both for class discussions and an illustrator study project (e.g., a Wiki page). The culminating illustrator study project involves an in-depth investigation of a key children's book illustrator and a process of sharing works-in-progress with classmates for collaborative editing.",3,3,Prerequisite:  ENGL 015 and 5th semester standing or higher

LATIN 203 Latin Reading and Composition (4)This four-credit course is at the intermediate-level and follows LATIN 003 or LATIN 102. It satisfies the 12th-credit foreign language requirement and prepares students to take 400-level Latin courses. The course is concerned with perfecting the knowledge of Latin grammar, which in the Middle Ages was considered to be the mother of the other Liberal Arts. This is accomplished by the review of grammatical rules and by the reading and explanation of Latin authors. The course reviews the forms, syntax, and vocabulary of Latin, and gives students practice exercises that improve translation skills. Equally important, students are introduced to the principles of Latin style by learning how to translate English into Latin. The review of Latin grammar and the introduction to Latin prose composition provide students with the competence to read representative Roman authors in poetry and prose. Rudimentary Latin readings, supported by school commentaries, are intended to familiarize students with famous examples of classical Roman literature while exemplifying the principles of classical Latin style. For the Republican period, students read selections of Caesar's Gallic Wars or a speech by Cicero and selections of Catullus's love poetry. For the Imperial period, one investigates different accounts of the rape of Lucretia by Livy and Ovid, in poetry and prose, respectively. These readings not only show how exemplary authors write in different styles, but how Latin language and literature lay the linguistic and cultural foundations of western civilization. Evaluation methods include assessment of students through in-class oral and written drills, in-class translation of Latin into English and English into Latin, weekly translation assignments, biweekly quizzes, two tests, and a final exam. These methods are intended to promote the learning of Latin vocabulary and grammar, to increase the comprehension of the assigned readings, and to foster an appreciation of the stylistic virtuosity of Rome 's greatest writers.",4,4,Prerequisite:  LATIN102

The course is premised on the idea that language is a crucial component in the formation of identity. To understand Latina/o identity formation in the U.S., then, one must analyze what role languages--Spanish and English--have played in identity formation. The class commences with a brief historical assessment of the various U.S. Latino communities, including Mexican-American, Cuban-American, and Puerto Rican communities. Such a historical purview proves significant in the study of the cultural traditions that persist in these communities, chief among these, the Spanish language. In exploring the Spanish language in U.S. Latino communities, we consider several major sets of questions, among them the following: In what ways do the languages of U.S. Latino communities differ from those of monolingual Spanish- (and English-) speaking communities? What factors contribute to the maintenance and loss of Spanish in these communities? How does language contribute to the creation of individual and societal identity? How is language exploited in the representation of other U.S. Latino cultural traditions? We consider these questions across a variety of genres: poetry, prose (autobiography in particular), film, art, television, and music. These texts reveal how social environments determine language use as well as how artists have used language to reshape social environments, through, for example, the development of new language practices such as Spanish-English code switching. The course also connects these cultural practices to debates on Spanish in public life and policy.",3,3,Cross-listed with: SPAN 315NUnited States Cultures (US)General Education: Humanities (GH)General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)General Education -  Integrative: InterdomainGenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies

Within educational settings, technology is not simply an independent curriculum -- i.e., teaching about how to use technology. Rather it is a powerful means for addressing, and potentially redefining, everyday teaching and learning issues. The potential of technology is most effectively realized when considered in combination with views about how individuals think and learn best. The goal of this course, then, is not for you to become an expert in 'technology,' but to become more of an expert in teaching and learning. Technology can be used as a vehicle to help you to further develop this expertise. This course is divided into five units which are based on the following areas of educational computing: (1) Technology Integration Concepts; (2) Productivity Tools; (3) Communication tools; (4) Interactive multimedia; and (5) emerging technologies.

L A 101H Honors Rhetoric and Civic Life (4) (GWS)This course offers students comprehensive training in oral, written, visual, and digital communication for the twenty-first century. It unites these various modes under the flexible art of rhetoric and uses the pedagogies associated with the rhetorical tradition both to strengthen communication skills and to sharpen critical awareness of the challenges and advantages presented by oral, written, visual, and digital modes. Students will read about and discuss rhetorical concepts and situations and put their knowledge immediately to use by analyzing civic rhetoric on campus and in their communities (including their networked communities), by researching current issues, and by developing and presenting arguments in oral, written, visual, and digital form. The course is designed (although not required) for first-year Schreyer Honors College students and Paterno Fellows aspirants in the College of the Liberal Arts. In other words, it appeals to students with well developed communication abilities who might otherwise take English 30 and/or CAS 100H. It is aimed at developing students' skills in composing and delivering purposeful and effective texts. Whether or not those discourses are delivered verbally or visually (on paper, electronically, or orally), students will draw on established rhetorical canons of invention, arrangement, style, memory (tapping the resources of stored knowledge, such as the library), and delivery. Students will also become fluent in the rhetorical appeals of ethos, logos, and pathos in order to shape texts that are ethical yet purposeful. To meet these goals, students will meet in small classes (of no more than twenty students), where they will receive guided instruction in writing, public speaking, and the use of technology in order to learn the distinctive features of oral, written, visual, and electronic rhetoric. Staff for the course will be experienced full time faculty and advanced doctoral candidates in rhetoric drawn from English and CAS. This course will satisfy the Gen Ed Writing/Speaking (GWS) requirement for Schreyer Honors College students and aspiring Paterno Liberal Arts Fellows.

ENGR 426ENGR (MGMT/IST/ENTR) 426 Invention Commercialization (3) The goal of ENGR (MGMT/IST/ENTR) 426 is to have students understand why invention commercialization is complicated and difficult by participating in the process. For example, the inventor rarely has insights into the markets for his/her invention, is often not interested in the details of commercialization, and can be secretive. In addition, the business and financial communities often do not take the time, or have the resources, to understand new technologies and perform complex due diligence. Thus lack of due diligence often leads to rejection of innovation because existing companies often discount new technologies from outside the company as NIH - 'not invented here'. Effective transfer of new invention or innovation to a commercial product requires at least three different functional communities to interface: technical, legal and business. Each uses a different language, comes from different educational and cultural backgrounds, and may have an inherent distrust of the others. These functional barriers are difficult to overcome.This course teaches how these barriers can be broken down as student teams help bridge the perceived chasm between key players in the invention commercialization process. In these teams, students bring the skills and knowledge from their major to develop an invention commercialization recommendation for the Technology Transfer Office and the inventor. For example, business students focus on finance and market opportunity assessment; engineering and IST students focus on design refinements, prototyping support, and (if appropriate) making technology suggestions to the inventor.Upon completing the course, the students will have a working knowledge of different university and corporate technology or invention commercialization processes, important intellectual property management tools for inventions (patents, license agreements, option agreements) source of funding to move inventions toward product development, and delivering top quality presentations which outline the recommended commercialization path. Students who enjoy open-ended projects which involve the interplay of business and invention of who wants to work on interdisciplinary teams with the newest inventions will find this course a valuable course. NOTE: Because the inventions/products are based on Penn State faculty intellectual property, students must sign the Penn State Special Intellectual Property Agreement For Students - For Use When Assigning Intellectual Property to The Pennsylvania State University.

MAE T 204W Structure Characterization Laboratory (3) This is a laboratory course for two year associate degree students with emphasis on equipment and techniques used for microstructural evaluation of metals. The objective is to provide students with practical laboratory skills in metallography and optical microscopy needed to observe and interpret microstructures of various metal alloys. Furthermore, the student gains valuable writing experience in preparing concise and effective technical reports.Lectures, videotapes, and demonstrations are used to introduce students to fundamental concepts and special techniques used in metallography and microstructural analysis of metals. The course begins with a brief overview of metallography and a discussion of safety in the laboratory. Elements of good technical report writing are introduced. Metallographic principles are presented using reference brochures and videotapes. This includes sectioning, mounting, coarse grinding,fine grinding, rough polishing, final polishing and microetching. Added topics cover the fundamentals of metallographs and photomicrography.A review of the iron-iron carbide system is given based upon material presented in MAE T 201 taught in the third semester of the materials program. Supplementary material on copper alloys is introduced latter in the course so that the physical metallurgy of brass and bronze can be better grasped by the student.This course has three laboratory experiments: (1) specimen preparation and optical microscopy, (2) characterization of powdered metal (P/Nl) iron and carbon steel alloys, and (3) characterization of wrought brass, wrought bronze, and sintered bronze alloys. Each experiment requires that the students prepare a technical report that is graded for its grammar, spelling, technical accuracy, and completeness. The student gains valuable experience in preparing metallographic specimens and appreciates the importance of achieving a representative structure. Laboratory work requires observing and interpreting microstructures of both wrought and porous P/N4 iron and carbon steel alloys. Quantitative metallography is used by students to estimate the carbon content of a selected P/M carbon steel alloy. Special metallographic techniques are learned for preparing porous P/1/4 alloys to reveal their true pore structure. The student develops experimental skills in measuring the density P/M samples and the surface hardness of polished metallographic samples. Also, experience at identifying microconstituents in non-ferrous based alloys is of particular value to the student. The technical reports require the presentation of Rockwell hardness and Knoop microhardness data in the form of tables and graphs.",3,3,Prerequisite:  M E  442W

MATH 450 Mathematical Modeling (3) The purpose of the course is to introduce mathematical modeling, i.e., the construction of mathematical structures which capture relevant physical phenomena. The course will systematically explore mathematical ideas and tools used to study the natural world. Particular emphasis will be placed on the process of creating a mathematical model starting from a physical scenario. Typically this process will begin with an experiment either demonstrated in the W. G. Pritchard Lab or performed by the students in class.Once a particular model has been developed, students will use mathematical analysis and experimentation to determine the properties and relevance of the model, and to make predictions. Often the model can be satisfactory; however, many times one also finds new features of the system that are not adequately accounted for in the model, and the process begins again. It is this cycle the course will focus on. For a given phenomenon (e.g., flow of viscous fluid, pendulum motion) several models may be compared and contrasted, and possible simplifications will be discussed.A significant aspect of the course is its laboratory component, in which the students will perform experiments or observe demonstrations. However, the main emphasis will be placed on creating and rigorously analyzing the mathematical aspects of the models. Instead of presenting a finely tuned model for a given phenomenon, this course will try to convey some of the heuristic, intuitive, and mathematical ideas employed in modeling.Examples of physical systems to be considered include: simple and compound pendulum motion, chemical oscillations, water waves, and elastic behavior of polymer solutions.The course is open to a wide range of undergraduate as well as graduate students with majors in mathematics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics. The course should be accessible to students with some basic knowledge of mathematical analysis and differential equations.

Moving from past to present, the course will use case studies to navigate historical moments where weather shaped the outcome. Each case study will have a historical, cultural, and meteorological analysis of the event so students gain a deeper understanding of the national or international event and the integration of science and history. Weather has shaped the outcome of major world events. For example, a weather forecast led to the delay of the Allied invasion of Normandy (DDay), record cold weather in Florida led to the Challenger Space Shuttle explosion, General George Washington used fog to conceal the withdrawal of his troops at the Battle of Long Island, and the list goes on. The case studies range from the Revolutionary War through present day, and this period of history has been selected because there are firsthand accounts of the weather and/or recorded weather data for each event. The meteorological study examines the event's atmospheric conditions. How or why did they occur? How did they affect the event? Therefore, students will learn basic meteorology and climatology. They will also analyze weather maps and scientific data. The historical study provides context for the event. What lead to the event? What happened during the event? What are the event's lasting impacts? To better understand the decisions that leaders faced, students will be asked to assess risk and make decisions based on the same weather data or information leaders at the time had. Students will also explain the context, cause, and effects of major historical moments in everyday language to an audience of their peers through discussions and/or projects. The cultural study examines each event from a psychological and sociological point of view. What were the mindsets of the people and cultures involved in the event? How does the event connect to or parallel things in today's society? How would a present day culture react? This study will give students a better understanding of cultural differences in the world and how those cultural differences can alter the course of history.

METEO 469 From Meteorology to Mitigation: Understanding Global Warming (3) Human-caused climate change represents one of the great environmental challenges of our time. As it is inextricably linked with issues of energy policy, a familiarity with the fundamentals of climate change is therefore critical for those looking to careers in the energy field. To appreciate the societal, environmental, and economic implications of policies governing greenhouse gas emissions, one must further understand the basic underlying science. METEO 469 serves to lay down the fundamental scientific principles behind climate change and global warming. A firm grounding in the science is then used as a launching point for exploring issues involving climate change impacts and mitigation. METEO 469 will introduce students to the basic information necessary for understanding Earth's climate, including the relevant atmospheric processes, and aspects of other key components of the climate system such as the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Students will learn how to do basic computations and to use theoretical models of the climate system of varying complexity to address questions regarding future climate change. Students, further, will explore the impacts of various alternative greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and investigate policies that would allow for appropriate stabilization of future greenhouse gas concentrations. The structure of the course roughly parallels the treatment of the subject matter by the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), focusing first on the basic science, then the future projections and their potential impacts, and finally issues involving adaptation, vulnerability, and mitigation.

6449,MUSIC 5,MUSIC,5,,An Introduction to Western Music,"MUSIC 5 is a course on listening, with emphasis on the relationship between musical style and historical context. Students will learn the basic skills of informed music-listening: how to hear and describe melody (phrase structure; motive; developmental strategies), harmony (the basic principles of the tonal system), rhythm (meter, tempo, and their application), timbre (including a full knowledge of the instrumental families [strings, winds, brass, percussion] and voice types), and texture (monophony, homophony, polyphony). Students will also become familiar with the eras of western musical history, and to consider relationships between musical style and non-musical developments (e.g. the intellectual environment of the Enlightenment and the Classical style in music). The course begins with an introduction to the elements of music. The goal of this section is to give all students, whether or not they have previous experience as performers, the basic skills necessary to approach any musical work as informed listeners. This activity takes four weeks. The remaining portion of the course is spent surveying the history of western music, with that history treated as a series of case studies: particular works are considered stylistically but also with regard to the historical circumstances of their production and consumption. From this activity students gain experience considering artworks in discipline-specific terms, even as they learn to relate particular artistic features to non-musical factors of culture and society. Two methods of evaluation are used. Examinations (the number determined by the instructor) test the students' mastery of the course material. Concert reports (again in a number determined by the instructor) give students the opportunity to apply that knowledge to the act of listening in an authentic performance setting.

The curriculum combines aspects of two existing courses, Rudiments of Music (MUSIC 8) and Introduction to Western Music (MUSIC 5), and includes curricular links to INART 50Z. Preliminary objectives will include basic musical information associated with tonality (the fundamental elements of music; the broad stylistic eras of western music and their associated characteristics). The main objectives of the course are: to explore techniques of tonal composition in detail, with an emphasis on conceptual understanding; to hear and recognize musical sounds and compositional devices within such comparative contexts as scales v. modes, diatonic v. chromatic, consonance v. dissonance, polyphony v. homophony; to hear and recognize fundamental harmonic relationships between tonic and dominant, as well as their importance in the formal design of tonal music; to enhance appreciation for classical music and to encourage attendance of live performances. Students will acquire knowledge of fundamental elements of music but not be required to learn to read or write notated music as fully as are students in MUSIC 8. Students will acquire knowledge of western music history, but they will not study as many composers nor as many pieces as is customary in MUSIC 5. Instead, students will be drawn closer to a smaller number of works, and closer to the performances and the performers. Specific compositional devices (e.g., suspension, sequence, textures, rhythms, harmonies) will be highlighted in detail. Curricular links to INART 50Z will introduce students to the arithmetic relationships between pitches, intervals, and the underlying natural phenomena upon which they are based. These objectives will be met by utilizing an interactive, multimedia online curriculum, including demonstration videos by the author, a virtual keyboard and music notation files (e.g., Sibelius).

Their songs are derived from diverse sources, such as rhythm 'n' blues, rock 'n' roll, country 'n' western, Motown, soul, folk music, folk rock, the British Music Hall, and European and Indian classical music traditions. Two ideas define their work: an emphasis on freedom, and how song texts can be interpreted in different ways. The Beatles had a great impact not only on American popular music during their heyday in the 1960s but also on the country' s popular culture in which they were considered philosopher kings. Beatle albums mirrored changing trends in the culture, from the pre-Vietnam War youthfulness of A Hard Day's Night, to the psychedelia of Revolver and Sgt. Pepper, to the countercultural mindset of The White Album. This inter-domain course will focus on how the Beatles influenced American popular culture from the 1960s to the present day. It will examine how the Beatles were a part of a mid-twentieth-century British youth subculture that was shaped by the cultural attitudes of American rock 'n' roll.

Skills and concepts from these classes will be applied in this authentic context in the collegiate and public school classrooms.The students will be assessed according to their effectiveness in observation, teaching preparation, teaching, and research. Evaluation will be in the form of written and verbal feedback, and completion of rubrics by the instructor and the students themselves (self- and peer-evaluation). Enrollment will likely be approximately 5 students each fall semester. Students will spend considerable class time in local public schools for fieldwork.",3,3,"Prerequisite:  MUSIC345 , MUSIC395B"

MUSIC 468 Acting for Singers (2)This is a course teaching singers the fundamentals of acting. All types of stage work related to vocal music will be explored from performing in recitals and concerts to the opera and excerpted scenes. The objective of the course is to make singers more comfortable on stage and more realistic/believable in their performances/presentations. This course differs from acting courses offered in other areas because the singer has restrictions placed upon him due to the requirements of the music, especially in regard to timing and the sense of time, and the use of texts which are often in foreign languages. The course will be offered to music majors currently studying voice at an advanced level (V220J or higher) so that vocal technique will not be the main issue; this includes students enrolled in the BM, BMA, BA, and BME programs. Exceptions can be made by permission of the instructor. The course is an elective 2 credit course which students may repeat for a maximum of 4 credits. An accompanist will be present to accompany students in their song/aria presentations. Every class meeting will begin with warm-up exercises and then continue with further exercises focusing on helping students develop a sense of timing and enabling them to explore the 'beats' (or central topic) of a scene. Emphasis will be placed on learning how to prepare for a scene, analyze it, and determining the goal(s) of the character. The students will be encouraged to learn how to be specific in their acting and to learn what will 'read' to an audience while accurately reflecting the portrayed emotion. Some work will be solo work, but there will also be opportunities to work with partners. Improvisation will also be incorporated.",2,2,Prerequisite:  Must be currently enrolled for voice jury track at the level of   V220J or higher or register with permission of the program

The initial third of the semester is devoted to studying the technical norms of a given style: melodic materials (scales, modes), harmonic structure (vocabulary, norms of harmonic motion), characteristic rhythmic practices (with particular attention to syncopation), special aural requirements (the ability to connect musical hearing and musical thought) and typical frameworks of contrapuntal organization in the appropriate types of ensemble. The final two thirds of the course then deal with applications of these materials in improvisational contexts, with a short section during the last two weeks devoted to developing keyboard skills, an important area of musical competence for any jazz performer. This course is appropriate for any music major or minor with an interest in jazz. Instruction will be delivered in one hour-long lesson per week.

In areas such as design and processing of electronic devices, materials engineering, chemical engineering, and combustion engineering, the science of statistical mechanics is a particularly necessary, powerful, and important tool for the engineer. The underlying foundation of statistical mechanics is developed by (1) reviewing the basic ideas from probability theory, (2) deriving the binomial, Poisson, and Gaussian probability distributions, and (3) using these models to analyze several examples taken from science and engineering. To make a connection between macroscopic quantities and the corresponding probabilistic representation, classical thermodynamics is reviewed using the internal energy, entropy, and free energy functions in the context of the first and second laws. Statistical mechanics for classical and quantum-mechanical systems is presented via the micro-canonical, canonical, and grand canonical ensembles using the associated partition functions. During the syntheses of ideas, applications from various branches of science are presented.

7163,PNG 450,PNG,450,,Drilling Engineering,"PNG 450: Drilling Engineering covers the design and analysis of oil-field drilling operations and equipment. This course addresses a critical issue in petroleum and natural gas engineering: how to drill and complete oil and gas wells in a sound, economical, and environmentally safe manner. Drilling technology has advanced greatly since the first commercial oil well in the U.S. was drilled in northwest Pennsylvania in 1859. The true vertical depth of the well has grown from 69.5 feet from then to more than 15,000 ft, with the deepest at more than 40,000 feet, today. The horizontal length of a well has grown from theoretically zero to more than 10,000 feet, with the longest at 40,000 feet. The temperature and pressure of the formation that petroleum engineers need to drill through could easily reach 350 F and 20,000 psi or higher, and the formation and fracture gradient window becomes narrower, all making drilling and completion more challenging. In summary, it is becoming increasingly more challenging to drill wells. Thus, engineering design becomes more critical. The objectives of this course are to introduce the students to the science of drilling and completion. This includes learning the fundamentals of drilling fluids and drilling fluid design, and applying fluid mechanics and quantifying drilling hydraulics for complex fluid flow through drilling string and annular spaces. The course will also discuss the concepts and quantify the formation pressure and fracture pressure gradients for different methods of drilling. A key task for students will be to learn the methods for characterization, selection and optimization of casing design, and optimized bit design, and finally the course will discuss how to design directional and horizontal wells to optimize production and recovery from mature fields and unconventional resources, such as coalbed methane, shale gas, and tight oil in Pennsylvania. This course is a prerequisite for petroleum and natural gas engineering major courses. It is an elective course for majors such as chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, etc. The knowledge, methods, and practical skills in this course could also be used in various other industries including geothermal HVAC, ground water drilling, mineral exploration, and scientific research.",3,3,Prerequisite: ( EME 303 or CE 360 or ME 320 ) and ( EMCH 210 or ( EMCH 211 and EMCH 213 ) )

The course focuses on the analysis of physical data with respect to error and use of this data in design. Other topics to be visited include a definition of what is a project deliverable and establishment of timelines for their implementation. The salient points of the course are as follows: (1)This course is the first capstone engineering design course in the sequence of three courses. In this portion of the course students' principal goal is to characterize the reservoir. In this process necessary basic sciences and engineering skills are utilized. (2)In reservoir characterization, students typically collect and analyze the data available in the literature and other related data provided by the operators. (3)In making a preliminary assessment towards field development students consider factors involving economic, environmental, social, ethical, health and safety considerations. (4)In this course, students work in teams. In each team, team members assume responsibilities as petrophysicist, drilling engineer, geologist, geophysicist production engineer, reservoir engineer and implement the necessary technical skill to fulfill their obligations. (5)This project starts from the ground level and ends with a complete field development plan. Within the context of the project (reservoir characterization) students have the opportunity to use the necessary skills to identify and formulate and solve the engineering problems and challenges that are faced. (6)In selecting the lease area the potential impact of project on the social and physical environments is considered and all the ethical responsibilities are studied in depth. (7)During every phase of the project the impact of decisions are considered within the framework of global, economic, environmental and societal context. (8)In this course the main contemporary issue the need for unconventional energy resources is the driving force behind the project. (9) In every phase of the project students are exposed to contemporary methodologies and engineering tools including forecasting, scenario planning and reservoir simulation.

Hegel focuses on the rationality implicit in the historical growth of religion and the political institutions of the state. As the century wears on, escalating social and political conflicts lend credibility to outspoken critics of such optimistic rationalism. Schopenhauer¿s pessimism, Kierkegaard's existentialist focus on the irrationality of faith, Marx's historical materialism and emphasis on class struggle, Nietzsche's ""genealogical"" anti-realism and philosophy of power are prominent examples.

Members of what came to be called the Frankfurt School were sharply critical of the political structures, social institutions, and culture of late capitalist societies such as Germany and the United States (where they lived and worked in exile during the Second World War). They were heavily influenced by the post-Kantian German philosophical tradition, especially the work of Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud.

7301,PHOTO 202,PHOTO,202,,Fundamentals of Professional Photography,"This professionally oriented photography course gives students a foundation in the techniques and other competencies relevant to professional photography. PHOTO 202 Fundamentals of Professional Photography is a professionally oriented problem based learning class where students are introduced to the fundamental technical and creative aspects of client centered photography relevant to careers in photography and photography related or dependent fields. Students will be introduced to the photographic techniques; professional practices; creative sensibilities; and cultural knowledge significant to the work of a professional photographer and fields reliant on or related to professional photography.  The course content focuses student attention on mastering the technical fundamentals of professional photography in the context of the photographer/client relationship. The learning problems place emphasis on the communication, collaboration, and cooperation necessary to solve visual photographic problems in a professionally oriented setting. Under these conditions, students must collaborate with their clients to foster creatively productive relationships and meet their photographic needs.  This problem requires developing communication and interpersonal relation skills, which require clearly understanding the clients' needs and educating them about the creative possibilities and limitations. Under this teaching and learning model, students must learn to merge their own creative vision with the needs and desires of their professional clients. These skills are directly applicable to the real world problems students will encounter in professionally oriented circumstances after they graduate.  In the learning problems student peers, with the instructor's guidance, will play dual roles of clients and photographers with the goal of concentrating the photographers' attentions on communicating with their clients to create effective and creative purpose-driven images. Consequently, the course places a greater emphasis on communication, collaboration, and cooperation than it does on personally and individually motivated expression.  Since the advent of digital photography, the medium has undergone an unprecedented period of technological, creative, and cultural flux. Digital photography, computer technology, and social media have had dramatic impact on the medium, which we expect will continue into the future. Consequently, we have used a problem based learning approach to ensure we can continuously address the most relevant and current topics and information. We have also chosen major teaching and learning topics, which will continue to meet the fundamental needs of the students even as technology continues to shift.  At the beginning of each semester, students and the instructors will work collaboratively to develop five student learning-problems. These problems or projects will address the major teaching and learning topics under a variety of conditions designed to reinforce the subject matter, encourage flexibly creative thinking, and allow students to pursue the subject with greater critical depth and awareness.",3,3,

It introduces the field of political theory as an intellectual tradition that combines reflection on what political life is and what it should accomplish with investigation of the values manifest through existing political institutions and how those institutions can be best organized to achieve desired outcomes. Through analysis of selected works of major thinkers, beginning with the Ancient Greeks and extending through the contemporary period, students consider questions and problems that philosophers, political leaders and citizens have grappled with for millennia: What is a political community? What is justice? Who is included in the realm of justice? What is the best form of government? What do I owe to the state? What does the state owe to me? What is the proper purpose and scope of government? Students learn to critically engage arguments in canonical texts to understand both how they contributed to debates in their own time and how subsequent theorists and activists have interpreted them to articulate and challenge various forms of exclusion and oppression. Ultimately, students are invited to see political theory as a conversation across time to clarify concepts that are fundamental to the study and practice of politics yet remain contested, such as freedom, equality, democracy and justice, and to distinguish between the legitimate purposes of government and the arbitrary use of power. Through the course students will learn to employ and evaluate political concepts with care and precision so they can participate in that conversation productively as democratic citizens as well as in further study of political theory.

7502,PLSC 90,PLSC,90,,Introduction to Security,"The study of security issues is more critical than ever, considering a series of global trends. Those reach from violent radicalization to arctic transformation, as well as include technology trends. All of those have an impact on security in our daily lives, in the public sector, and in the private sector. Together, both states and individuals are confronted with many pressing and often competing local, national, and global security challenges that demand thoughtful responses and solutions. Particularly challenging is the need to put in place security measures while ensuring that they do not infringe on the values they aim to protect. The multifaceted security crises of our time is rooted in a broad spectrum of hazards. It among other things stretches across lone wolf terrorists, natural disasters, public health emergencies, transnational organized crime, and cyber attacks; and it includes global counterterrorism, counterproliferation, and environmental change. All of those represent significant problems facing our world today. At the same time, they provide opportunities for us to bring about changes that will significantly increase the ongoing quality of life around the world. In order to do so, it is essential to develop analytical skills for risk assessment, policy analysis and strategy development. Critical thinking skills are also crucial since we need to be able to identify security gaps, unreasonable securitization trends, and point out fallacies of reasoning and misrepresentation of facts that may occur when responding to security threats. In this course, we will review the historical evolution of security studies, national and international security policies and strategies, human security and security management in business and industry. Further, in the rapidly changing world of security studies, it is important to understand the critical differences between concepts like strategic security, counterterrorism, protection, intelligence, homeland security, criminal justice, conflict studies, emergency management, threat assessment, human security, crisis management, disaster management, and related terms. Based on this, students will learn how security issues relate to their chosen academic discipline and professional goals. Using real-world examples, students will develop understanding of the academic, historical, and technological evolutions that gave rise to the field of security studies, and go in-depth to examine the main areas in which security strategists, analysts, and practitioners work.",3,3,General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason
7505,PLSC 114Z,PLSC,114,Z,Winning Political Support Through Persuasion,"The purposes of this course are to introduce students to the comparative study of political systems, some of their parts, and the functioning of those parts, and to develop a capacity for effective, ethical citizenship. Real-world attempts to convince various audiences will be analyzed with respect to their appeals to the emotions of their respective audiences, often through framing the candidacy or policy under consideration in ways intended to stimulate fear, hope, or anxiety in order to command the attention of audiences. The use of words, other symbols, and non-verbal stimuli with strong emotional and normative content will be highlighted. The class will also evaluate efforts to establish credibility with audiences through references to endorsements, demonstrations or claims of expertise, goodwill, and good sense. Lastly, the logical validity of inferences and deductions made in the attempts to convince will be considered so that flattery, manipulation, bargaining, deception, and intimidation can be distinguished from genuine persuasion. Materials presented in Philosophy 10 (GH), ""Critical Thinking,"" to which PLSC 114 is linked, will provide students with the tools to do this. So that students might see how characterizations of attempts to convince might be placed into a provisional context, the study is comparative. It will look at attempts in the U.S. as well as some other country. In general, so that the attempts at winning over audiences might be as comparable and as comprehensible as possible, the issue should be as similar as possible and the other country should be Anglophone. Although systems of elections and governance and controversial issues inevitably vary within and between countries, it is possible to find elections and policy controversies with sufficient similarities to make cross-national comparisons of attempts at convincing their respective audiences a fruitful exercise. For example, one might build the course around the televised debates and campaign ads for the mayoral elections in Vancouver and Seattle and the efforts to generate support and opposition to oil pipelines in the two countries. By looking at the different strategies used in attempts to convince elites, the citizenry and parts of the citizenry in the two countries, it is possible to raise questions about the workings of the political systems in the two countries. Specifically, students can examine some of the ways that historical geopolitical, constitutional, economic, and demographic differences between and within the two countries are manifested in the political processes of the two countries. By leading students to consider such questions, this course can induce them to undertake further study that will equip them with the methodological tools to investigate these issues in greater depth. Moreover, by providing students with the basic outlines of well-supported valid inference and challenging them to detect of the most common informal fallacies in efforts to convince and create an outline for their own attempt at political persuasion, PLSC 114 (GS) will help build capabilities that are necessary for responsible and effective and ethical citizenship.",3,3,CONCURRENT: PHIL 10

They look specifically at the role of rights in the founding documents of United States and how civil rights are interpreted through pivotal Supreme Court cases as ascribing - or denying - particular powers and responsibilities to individuals and groups. The second section of the course focuses on the rights of African Americans and women. It progresses chronologically from slavery to the modern civil rights movement, from coverture to women's rights. Particular attention is given to the NAACP's campaign against racial discrimination in housing, education, and in the criminal justice system. The final part of the course emphasizes campaigns for rights recognition in modern times, including LGBTQ rights and disability rights. The course concludes with a discussion of how context impacts rights, including students' rights and rights during wartime, and examination of the potential and limitations of rights as a basis for political protection. Throughout the course students are introduced to the interdependent political, legal and philosophical dimension of rights and how rights in the United States have come to be recognized and enforced through political action, legal codification, and judicial interpretation.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral SciencesUnited States Cultures (US)General Education: Humanities (GH)General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)General Education -  Integrative: InterdomainGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason

The engagement of women in sport has unique physiological considerations and ethical dilemmas as well as a rich history of defining moments and important ties to feminism and politics. In this course, students will learn how physiology differences affect female athletic performance and the effects of exercise on the female body, as well as how cultural, historical, and political forces shaped women's participation in sport. Students will also see how similar historical, cultural, and political forces affect women's involvement in politics. Combined, students will understand how similar forces shape gender norms and participation two different, yet related, aspects of society. Additionally, students will learn about the push for evidence-based policymaking and apply that knowledge to topics including doping, pregnancy, and gender verification. Students will integrate physiology and policy in a final assignment advocating for evidence-based sport policy.

7523,PLSC 235,PLSC,235,,Environmental Politics,"This course explores the political implications of climate change and the increasing scarcity of many of the world's resources. It provides students with an understanding of the actors and issues driving debates over decision-making and the use of natural and economic resources, with a focus on the American political process. The first part of the course presents the frameworks, actions and interests of various policy actors who affect environmental decision-making and the formation and implementation of environmental policies. The second part develops specific environmental issues, including climate change, resource scarcity and waste management. Much of the reading assumes that our civilization faces the twin problems of increasingly serious shortages of resources and a growing ecological crisis that threatens the basis of life. Further, it argues that these twin crises feed upon each other, and that together they pose serious short and long run challenges to survival. Some readings attribute these problems to the dominant values that characterize modern Western society. The course does consider some dissents from this perspective, arguments that things will be just fine. However, it concentrates on problems and predictions of trouble. It recognizes that most of what we learn, read, and see supports the status quo and assumes our civilization and energy-dependent way of life will continue. Consequently, it emphasizes the less frequently argued position that we may be headed for disaster. The class aspires to appeal to students regardless of major or college -- to scientists, engineers, students of the humanities, and even economists and political scientists. It fulfills the University-wide general education requirement in Social Science. Although it discusses the role of politics in general and the role of the American political system in particular in discussing the ""twin crises,"" it mostly grapples with fundamental questions of value that underlie and guide the play of power in our political system and with how the massive changes now taking place globally both affect and are affected by politics.",3,3,Cross-listed with: STS 235Bachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral SciencesGeneral Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason

It is common for political outcomes to be determined by the interaction of individuals seeking goals in an environment in which goal attainment is complicated by the choices of other actors. This course introduces various methods for analyzing strategic behavior using social choice and game theories. We will employ these approaches to better understand a wide range of political phenomena in international politics, comparative politics, and American politics, such as war, terrorism, voting, electoral competition, government formation, and democratic transitions. By the end of the course, students will, among other things, have experience using games to analyze a range of political behaviors and institutions.

7547,PLSC 414,PLSC,414,,Dictators and Their Demise,"Dictators and Their Demise examines the political economy of authoritarian rule.  PL SC 414 Dictators and Their Demise (3) Dictators and Their Demise provides a broad exploration about how non-democratic governments throughout the world rule. We examine: the conditions that give rise to authoritarianism; the variety of authoritarian regimes; the strategies authoritarian leaders use to stay in power; the consequences of different types of authoritarianism for outcomes such as economic growth and human development; and the domestic and international sources of authoritarian demise. The course covers cases of authoritarian rule in: Chile, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, and the former Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo or DRC). The course builds knowledge about the governments under which most people in the Global South lived during the 20th century. Even today, roughly half of the world's population lives under some form of non-democratic government. Yet almost all courses currently in the curriculum, particularly in the field of comparative politics, focus exclusively on democratic forms of government. This course therefore examines a new topic not currently offered in the curriculum. In additional to learning about different types of authoritarian rule, students form an understanding of how common foreign policy tools, such as economic sanctions, foreign aid, and human rights shaming, are likely to affect domestic politics in these countries. This knowledge helps students critically evaluate foreign policy relationships between democracies, such and the United States, and dictatorships. Course materials cover theoretical approaches to the study of authoritarian rule, in-depth case studies (including novels, biographies, and documentary), and empirical research. This course requires student presentations, weekly reading assignments, descriptive analysis of quantitative data in graphs, multiple written assignments, and a final take-home essay exam. Students develop analytic skills through the weekly written homework assignments in which they apply the broad theoretical concepts to analyze counter factual situations from specific cases of authoritarian rule. Oral presentations develop inter-personal skills and require students to research specific cases of authoritarian rule currently in the news. This helps students critically evaluate current events. Finally, the written assignments require students to develop skills working with real data. Students collect and graphically present basic descriptive data about economic and human development in non-democratic countries: economic data, infant mortality, literacy, and indicators of women's well-being. Using real world data to make international comparisons helps students develop skills to form and articulate complex arguments, and teaches them the basics of research design.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral Sciences

It examines the role that women play in politics in the United States and around the world. Students will begin by examining how women are socialized differently from men and how that socialization effects women's political attitudes and participation. Then students will focus on women in different political offices and how their behavior compares to that of their male counterparts. Students will then analyze the women's movement in the United States. Finally, students will turn to different theories of the ideal position of women and men in politics and use those theories to explore the issue of pornography. Students will be evaluated on a final exam, short essays ( 4 3-5 page essays), class participation, and a research paper (15 pages). This is an advanced course with 6 credits prerequisite in Women's Studies or Political Science. This course fulfills the American Politics and Comparative Politics distribution as well as the advanced course requirement for the Political Science major.

PL SC 433 Political Foundations of the Early American Republic (3)The course introduces students to the major political and philosophical movements that influenced the founders of the early American republic. The first section of the course, set in the ancient world, will examine the earliest experiments in democratic government in both Greece and the Roman Republic. In addition to studying the structure and traditions of ancient governments, students will consider competing theories for why these early democratic experiments ultimately failed. The second section of the course traces the gradual evolution of representative democracy in Britain from the signing of Magna Carta to the quiet subjugation of the monarchy in the 19th Century. Recognizing that the theoretical structures of political power remain somewhat fixed in this period, students will consider how legal precedent can gradually transform seemingly static political institutions. The third section of the course examines American efforts to establish stable representative institutions in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War. Looking back at both ancient and modern constitutional traditions, students will examine how prior democratic experiments heavily influenced the deliberations of the founders both at the Constitutional Convention and in the establishment of the new federal republic.",3,3,Prerequisite:  PL SC001 or HIST 020 or PL SC017

PL SC 436 Civil Wars (3) This course provides a broad exploration of the causes, characteristics, and consequences of civil wars. In particular, it investigates what makes civil wars more likely to occur, what influences how long they last, how severe they are, and how likely they are to recur, while also considering their consequences for the states that experience them. It considers the scholarly research on this topic over the past decade or more, and builds an awareness both for what are the known regularities as well as what are the continuing uncertainties about the place of civil war in the contemporary international system. It does this specifically within the context of scientific research about civil wars, and thus also advances student knowledge about how social scientists learn what they know about how the world works. Building on this perspective, and after absorbing the lessons to be learned from the literature, students will gain even greater appreciation for the quality of knowledge about civil wars by conducting their own detailed analysis of a civil war (each student will study one civil war of their choosing) asking how well the civil war they study fits patterns identified by the literature. This course complements, without duplicating, existing political science courses about militarized political conflict, and qualifies as one course majors can take to satisfy their 400-level course hours requirement.

It draws on research being done in a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields including social, developmental and clinical psychology; the cognitive neurosciences; biological anthropology; genetics; evolution; and behavioral economics to examine political behavior. Specifically, the course will examine the thinking and actions of both political elites and the mass public, and consider the reasoning processes they employ in order to make sense of the political world. Topics to be covered include how emotions (e.g., fear, lust) shape human reasoning; how preferences develop; how differences in cognition, emotion and personality inform political judgment and shape political leadership; how prejudices develop and affect war and other conflicts; how political and social identities develop and how they affect individuals' political judgments and decisions; how neurobiological influences operate in conjunction with social and cultural factors to affect how individuals process information; and how genetics and hormones affect individuals political development and behavior. Through these and other topics covered in the course, students will develop an understanding of how political elites and ordinary citizens process information, develop preferences and make decisions, and why, as a consequence, they act as they do.

PL SC 488 Comparative Public Policy (3) Comparative Public Policy is an upper level political science course that includes components of comparative politics, public administration, and descriptive economics. The course presumes that developed industrial democracies confront common challenges in meeting human needs and that policy comparison is worthwhile despite distinctive societies and political cultures. For example, government involvement in the provision of health care varies widely from Britain's National Health Service to the largely private approach of the United States. Nevertheless all health care systems confront rising technology costs, an ageing population, and rising performance expectations. A primary purpose of the course is to consider the origin and development of individual country programs while assessing the common challenges. Cross national comparison becomes relevant to the course by including some available data on costs, implementation and outcomes. Because the course includes about six distinct areas, e.g., education, taxation, urban planning income support, and overall macroeconomic policy, the course will depict profiles of policymaking in Europe, North America and Japan. Ideally comparison should help students to evaluate the effectiveness of policy choices of a particular country and government. A second objective of the course will be to examine the national approaches to the relationship between the state and private economic activity. Not only does government expenditure amount to nearly half of some country's total output, government choices create distinctive legal environments for business activity. Antitrust, health, wage, and consumer regulation offer an excellent point of comparing different incentives for economic activity in the United States and Europe. Apart from policy choices mentioned in the first paragraph, the regulation of economic activity has cumulative results for employment and the distribution of income. This portion of the course is intended to be somewhat more elementary than the first because of the probability that students will be less familiar with its content. The primary objective will be to help students understand the variations among market economies and reasons for their description as ""neo-liberal,"" ""social market,"" or ""corporatist."" Finally, the course will examine some current ideas about recent changes in the global economy and their consequences for national policy. Clearly ""globalization"" has become a matter of political concern owing to its consequences for the creation of wealth, employment, growth and distribution. While the course cannot devote detailed or exclusive to the European Union, Europe's response to rapid movements in short term capital and investment presents an interesting point of comparison with the United States and Japan. The course should enable students to understand the meaning and criticism of ""globalization"" as a factor in shaping some national policies.",3,3,Prerequisite:  PL SC003

7700,PSYCH 256,PSYCH,256,,Introduction to Cognitive Psychology,"This course is an introduction to cognition, an area of psychology that investigates the ways in which we acquire, store, create and use knowledge. Cognition includes a wide range of mental processes that are used every day in almost all human activities. These include neuroscience, attention, perception, memory, imagery, language, problem solving, creativity, and reasoning. Cognition refers to a theoretical approach in psychology that emphasizes the role of people's knowledge, reasoning, and expectations and this approach has had a broad influence on all areas of psychology. It also involves developing sophisticated methodologies to study processes that are not always observable. Cognitive research can be applied in order to improve mental functioning, e.g., developing programs for improving memory or cognitive rehabilitation for brain injury. It can also be used to address serious societal issues and problems such as understanding how people develop and use stereotypes, or why distraction by a cell phone is dangerous. Cognitive psychology has applications to many fields including medicine, the legal system, education, and understanding mental disorders. In addition, cognitive psychology is part of the active interdisciplinary field of cognitive science that also includes disciplines such as philosophy, neuroscience and artificial intelligence. This course provides an overview of the field of cognitive psychology, including its research, theory, and application.

7706,PSYCH 269,PSYCH,269,,Evolutionary Psychology,"Survey of evolutionary perspectives in current psychological research.  PSYCH 269 Evolutionary Psychology (3) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.This course demonstrates how knowledge and principles from evolutionary biology are used to conduct research on the design of the human mind. The course explains how evolutionary psychologists identify adaptive problems faced by our ancestors and test hypotheses about psychological mechanisms designed by natural selection to solve these adaptive problems. The psychological mechanisms discussed are involved in phenomena such as perception and the control of activity, learning and cognition, mate selection and courting, development and parenting, altruism, aggression, and social structure. Evolutionary psychology is thus not a topic area such as perception, learning, or motivation, but rather a way of thinking that can be applied to any topic within psychology. The course, therefore, shows how evolutionary psychology is (1) changing how scientists approach old topics, (2) opening up new areas of research, and (3) beginning to provide a unifying framework for integrating the various subdisciplines of psychology. Students will learn to understand and evaluate evolutionary hypotheses about a range of topics in psychology and related social sciences. Evaluation will be based on a combination of methods, including for example traditional exams, written homework, papers, and participation in class and group discussions.

PSYCH 370 Psychology of Differently-Abled (3) (US) In 1991 President Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) which recognized that the hundreds of thousands of Americans living with disabling conditions form a class which should receive protection under the law. Many people look at the ADA as civil rights legislation which is intended to offer disabled Americans the same legal rights to access as the Civil Rights legislation of the 60s offered to Americans of color.While discrimination in the workplace, in housing, and in other areas based on race is no longer openly practiced, people with different physical abilities are still fighting an uphill battle. Often the barriers they face are due to ignorance of their needs. The intent of this course is to increase awareness and sensitivity to the needs of people who are different in the physical dimension. Additionally, policy and economic implications will be studied.The content will include multiple modalities, such as mobility and visual differences. The focus will be positive, emphasizing how differences in one area are overshadowed by similarities in most areas. Language in the course will focus on the positive as well, hence Psychology of the 'Differently-Abled' rather than 'Disabled'. Accomplishments of people such as FDR and Mozart will be discussed in the context of significant contributions made by people who were physically different. Finally direct experience with people will be obtained through a community service component of the course.The objectives of this course are to first familiarize students with the causes and consequences of different physical challenges. The long term objective is to increase sensitivity to the needs of people who are different from most of us in some ways, but very similar to us in most ways. Research has shown that familiarity is a critical tool in raising comfort levels and decreasing discriminatory and hurtful acts.Evaluation Methods: Examinations 40%, mid-term and final Community Service 30%, this will be assigned through the same form Internship supervisors use to evaluate students for PSYCH 395 Research Paper 25% Oral Presentation 5%, 15 minute presentation to class regarding their community service experience.

Is language a special and uniquely human ability that develops and functions independently of other cognitive processes? Do individuals who speak different languages also have different concepts about the meaning of objects and ideas? Does language development depend on exposure to spoken language? In this course we will examine the relation between language and thought by considering evidence on language and cognition in both children and adults. Topics to be covered include the typical development and use of language as well as language and cognition in individuals whose language and/or cognition is impaired in some form. The latter include individuals with aphasia who have sustained brain damage following stroke or head injury, schizophrenics whose language reflects aspects of their disorder, children diagnosed with Williams Syndrome who appear to have good or even precocious language abilities in the face of severe cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's patients in whom semantic memory has begun to deteriorate. The course will also discuss the acquisition of sign language among deaf individuals and the consequences of bilingualism for children raised with two languages and for adults with proficiency in more than a single language.The purpose of this course is to provide a survey of current scholarship on the relation of language and thought, including a review of recent developments in the primary literature. The necessary background is covered in introductory Psychology and Linguistics courses, which serve as alternative prerequisites. Students will learn about the consequences of typical and impaired development for relations between cognition and language ability.

This course will enable students to understand the definition of murder, within various classifications of it used in the United States, in particular the phenomenon of serial and mass murder. Students will be able to examine and understand within a historical context the cultural development of monsters, demons and evil and this relationship to serial and mass murder. Importantly, students will explore the biological and genetic foundations of human behavior, develop an understanding of the Diagnostic and Statistical manual (DSM-V) spectrum of personality disorders and how these disorders relate to violent behavior. Hare's PCL-R (Psychopathy Check List- Revised) factors will be examined alongside the examination of serial murder committed by legally insane offenders. Some, but not all serial killers have documented cases of mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia), personality disorders (e.g. borderline and antisocial), and psychopathy, albeit most mass murderers suffer from various psychoses. In addition, students will be able to understand sociological theories as they pertain to violent behavior and include factors such as, the role of the family, sexual and physical abuse, and maladaptive childhood behaviors. Often serial murders are preceded by perpetrators' (i.e., males) use of various types of criminal paraphilia (violent or non-violent). These are examined by students to understand the roles these play in the sexual fantasy development of (i.e., males) perpetrators and specific types of sex crimes. The healthcare industry, a hidden, but important environment for serial murderers, is examined by students in order to understand how occupations are important to serial murderers, as by way of their employment, many have easy access to victims. There are numerous differences between male and female serial killers, and team killers. These differences are explored by students by reviewing case studies of each, which include their profiles, mobility and techniques. Finally, global mass and serial murder is to be explored by students, which compare methods, motives and demographics.

Throughout the course students will engage with various service providing agencies (which may include sensory disabilities, intellectual/cognitive disabilities, and physical disabilities). Class time will be allotted to prepare for engagement and reflection as well as providing background information for understanding global policy and how to make comparisons. Students will participate in a culminating activity, such as attending the International Disability Summer School that equips students with the insights and skills necessary to translate the generalities of international positions on disabilities into tangible reform for persons with disabilities and understand disability from a global perspective.

7940,RLST 4,RLST,4,,Jewish and Christian Foundations,"This course seeks to help students better understand the Bible and appreciate its role as an authoritative collection of sacred texts for Jews and Christians. The Bible is a difficult book, one that is demanding on many levels. In order to read the Bible intelligently, it is important to understand the historical and cultural backgrounds of the biblical writings. This course explores the history and geography of ancient Near Eastern civilizations that shaped the experience of ancient Israel and, later, the Greek and Roman imperial contexts that shaped Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity. The focus of the course, however, is on the biblical narrative itself and the particular ways that the story of Israel and its covenant with God was represented in scripture: in tales, poems, hymns, dialogues, and genealogies. A basic goal of the course, then, is to promote intelligent, well-informed reading of the Bible. Also important is the willingness to read the Bible closely and critically, with a view toward larger questions raised by biblical texts: how is God to be known and understood? What is the purpose of human life in the world? What moral obligations ought to structure our common life? Does human history have direction and purpose? What is the good and how do we follow it? The Bible takes up these questions and many more. Though an ancient anthology shaped by the succession of Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman empires, the Bible is not merely a product of its original contexts. Millennia of transmission and interpretation have made it a product of history in a much more extended and dynamic sense. In this course, we will examine larger questions raised by the biblical writers and consider the ways that the Bible has shaped, informed, and guided Jewish and Christian ways of life.",3,3,"Cross-listed with: CAMS 4, JST 4Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesBachelor of Arts: Other CulturesInternational Cultures (IL)United States Cultures (US)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies"

It will also look at how these traditions were understood in early Judaism and nascent Christianity. Special attention will be paid to the roles of priests, kings, and prophets in ancient Israel to better understand Israelite and Judaean prophetic traditions in ancient Israelite society. The course will then examine the rise of apocalypticism and its medieval and modern manifestations including a brief look at Islam.

Topics to be covered include immigration, acculturation, ethnicity, gender, politics, and communal and religious innovation. While ""knowing the facts"" is obviously important to historical understanding, this course helps students develop critical thinking skills. These skills include: close and thoughtful reading and analysis of primary and secondary sources; looking for a broader coherence or ""order"" to the material; independent analysis and effective articulation (both in writing and in class discussion) of well-reasoned, well-crafted conclusions and interpretations and arguments (conclusions/interpretations/arguments which are supported by specific factual evidence derived from a variety of sources). The three specific course objectives underscore its scholarly dimensions: (1) Students will gain a knowledge and understanding of the relationship between the experiences of members of the American Jewish community and United States history as a whole. (2) Students will gain an understanding and knowledge of the political, economic, and social processes that shaped the American Jewish experience. (3) Students will learn how to ""think historically"" by placing documents written in the past in their historical contexts, and to consider the relationship of the past to the present. By the end of the course students will: Demonstrate an understanding of the chronology of American Jewish history.

What can be known about the historical figure of Jesus the Palestinian Jew? How would his teachings and actions have fit in the context of Judaism of his day, in the Greco-Roman world? What did he mean when he proclaimed the coming kingdom of God? Because almost all of our source material espouses Jesus as the Christ of Christian faith, the first step is to understand the aims and perspectives of these Christian sources, including the canonical Gospels as well as non-canonical Gospels. Through careful examination of these sources in light of critical scholarship and the social and historical context of Judaism in the Greco-Roman world, we will consider how much the historian is able to reconstruct of Jesus using historical method, what the limits of this investigation are, and how relevant the task is. We will consider and evaluate a few of the different scholarly reconstructions of the historical Jesus. Major emphases will include the historical, social, religious, political, and cultural contexts of Jesus, including important precursors; the political, institutional, and cultural history of the teachings and actions of Jesus in their Jewish setting, and how these are reinterpreted by his followers after his death. Attention will be paid to the development of variant Christian traditions about Jesus including Jesus as Messiah, his death as a saving event, the resurrection as exaltation of Jesus as Lord, the memorialization of Jesus in Christian ritual practice, and the cultural and religious impact of Jesus throughout history. In addition to the early Christian sources on Jesus (especially the canonical Gospels, but also other New Testament texts and non-canonical writings), on each topic students will read selections from early Jewish writings in order to illuminate the cultural context. These include the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Jewish texts among the so-called Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, early rabbinic texts, and epigraphical writings.

7964,RLST 124,RLST,124,,Early and Medieval Christianity,"This course provides an introduction to the history of Christianity. It traces, specifically, the development of the Christian movement from its beginnings as a small Jewish sect in Jerusalem to its unlikely emergence as the religion of the Roman Empire and, finally, its subsequent spread and development in Europe, Asia, and Africa. In form and structure, the course is historical, following figures and events in a more or less chronological sequence and taking up questions of causality, influence, and social identity. Yet the course is also concerned with the ideas, concepts, and philosophical viewpoints that have shaped Christianity and given it a certain intellectual coherence over time. The course begins with first-century construals of messianic identity and also with the figure of Jesus, as he was portrayed in the New Testament gospels. It then follows the first generations of the Christian movement, considering it within the context of first-century Judaism and the early Roman empire. Topics include persecution, martyrdom, and the important contributions of Origen. The middle section of the course looks at the second, third, and fourth centuries through three lenses, as it were: the office of bishop, the rise of monasticism, and the realities of empire. Bishops, monks, and emperors all shaped Christianity in essential ways, creating a rich and complicated spiritual, moral, theological, intellectual, and geo-political legacy for generations to come. The final third of the course looks at the development of Christianity beyond the fourth century in geographical groupings including churches in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, western Europe, Byzantium, and the Slavic lands. It is hoped, in all of this, that students will gain an understanding not only of Christian history but also of what made - and what makes - Christianity a distinctive and influential religion.",3,3,"Cross-listed with: CAMS 124, JST 124Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesInternational Cultures (IL)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies"

The course emphasizes modern and contemporary contexts of gender/religion debates, introducing feminist historical methods in order to trace the origins and trajectories of today's controversies. Students should expect to gain a comparative historical perspective on at least three theological traditions. Possible topics include: history of gender and religious practices; femininities and masculinities in a spiritual context; the flesh and the spiritual body; and sexuality, and both ethical and theological approaches to theories of gender, feminism, and identity. We will explore ways in which religious teachings, in both historical and contemporary contexts, inform secular understandings of gender and the ways in which contemporary conceptions of gender inform religious practice. While religion plays a crucial role in defining sex and gender norms, changing sex and gender norms can pressure the doctrine, discourses, practices and organizational structures of faith institutions, some established centuries or millennia ago. The course considers not only the roles of women and men, or constructions of masculinity and femininity, but also the impacts of non-binary genders and sexualities that may be acceptable (even celebrated) in some religions and shunned in others. We will address urgent and perennial questions from different religious perspectives: what is the spiritual meaning of sexuality? Is sexuality an obstacle or a vehicle for spiritual fulfillment? Who are the voices of authority who set the sacred rules on sexuality and who gets to enforce them? How do we (or should we) balance the tensions of non-aligned government and religious concerns, as in contemporary debates around same-sex marriage; abortion and reproductive rights; legal definitions of ""family""; the Muslim veil in secular contexts; divorce; trans rights; attitudes toward the body; gender mutilation and/or sex-reassignment surgery; sexual violence towards women, gay, and trans individuals around the world; child and sexual abuse among the clergy; and religious leadership and inclusion.

RM 440 Risk, Strategy, and Decision Making (3) One of the key ways that a business attempts to manage risk it anticipates and confronts in markets is through organizational-level elements such as its business strategy, structure, and culture. These elements emerge from a series of decisions guided by the insights and biases of individuals. As such, the management of enterprise risk must also include an understanding of how individuals (e.g. managers) approach risk through their decisions and decision making processes. In this course, we look at some of these critical elements separately and then together as they integrate to guide and define enterprise risk management. The basic course objectives are to come away with an understanding of the following: Forms of strategic risk - From market to internally-driven risk; from emotional to economic-driven, how does strategic risk present itself? How do executives recognize/assess and respond to the ""portfolio of risk"" that they must address to make the business successful? Business strategy and structure - One way risk is addressed and articulated is through a business strategy. What is strategy? What are the key decisions that comprise a business strategy? How are organizations structured to implement these strategies and move information across the firm? Where and how is risk assessed in these processes and structures, and incorporated into a strategic risk plan? Decision making - Decision making around strategy and risk management plays out in various forms and across different levels (i.e., individuals and groups). What goes right and wrong? How are these processes systematically linked to perceptions and actions associated with risk management. Organizational culture - Perhaps one of the most critical elements in enterprise risk management is the role played by organizational culture (or simply ""How we do things around here and my role as an organizational member doing it."") We examine the roots of organizational culture and how it is aligned to perspectives of risk and its management. Descriptive vs. prescriptive perspectives - Once we ""described"" what does/could go on, we need to engage in looking at ways that organizations can prevent pitfalls and correct suboptimal practices.",3,3,Enforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: RM 320W or RM 330W

The rise of Wall Street's interest in real estate securities is an important institutional development and serves as the underlying background for the analysis of MBSs using fixed-income security techniques. As globalization has spread, the real estate sector has moved with these changes and prospects for a global real estate market are examined and evaluated. This course serves as a compliment to FIN 460, which emphasizes traditional financial analyses of individual real estate projects.

Five structural concepts or key themes - local knowledge, relational knowledge, empirical knowledge, spiritual knowledge, and traditional knowledge - provide a conceptual framework for understanding indigenous cultures and knowledge production and their unique contributions to western society in the 21st century. Students will be introduced to the Algonquian cultures of the Great Lakes Region and to the Ojibwe (Anishinaabeg), Odawa, and Potawatomi (Three Fires) cultures in particular. This course will introduce students to the distinctive ways indigenous people experience, understand, and know the world through their relationship with the land or region to which they belong. Too often, colonizers around the world have ignored indigenous knowledge systems even though these ways of knowing have sustained peoples, cultures, and environments for thousands of generations. Because these ways of knowing are generally preserved and transmitted through stories, music, ceremony, and embodied traditions, they are seldom understood and frequently dismissed by those who control the production of knowledge in the modern world. The knowledge of the indigenous peoples of the Great Lakes region will, in this course, be presented as an empirically grounded scientific body of knowledge and theory comparable and complementary to the European tradition and, in specific ways, enhancing the sustainability of western scientific knowledge and practice. This course is a prerequisite for the Maymester field experience - Exploring Indigenous Ways of Knowing among the Ojibwe CED 401 which offers students an opportunity to experience indigenous ways of knowing by engaging with Ojibwe educators, traditional knowledge holders, elders, and families in several of the three largest Ojibwe reservations in the US.",3,3,Prerequisites: RSOC 11; SOC 1

RUS 083S First-Year Seminar in Russian (3) (GH;FYS;US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.Russia, the world's largest country stretching over eleven time zones in Europe and Asia, is currently undergoing a dramatic transformation. For the past hundred years, Russia has served as a laboratory of gigantic dimensions as various social ideals were implemented with unprecedented radicalism. At the same time, Russia's great writers raised 'ultimate questions' about social justice, the existence of God, and the meaning of human life with an unparalleled acuity and intensity. This course surveys Russia's cultural past and present. Although it touches on aspects of Soviet culture, the main emphasis lies on what some people would call the 'real Russian culture,' eclipsed for seventy years under the Communist regime and now about to be resurrected. At this crucial juncture in the history of Russia, the notion of a 'real' culture remains highly problematic and controversial. The course surveys the various attitudes of Russian thinkers and authors toward the question of national identity and national destiny. Examples of Russian high culture (philosophy, literature, art, music) and the Russian religious faith (Orthodoxy) are discussed alongside with daily life in post-communist Russia. Special emphasis will be placed on the in-depth study of a few seminal works of Russian literature. The course also includes some Russian films. A knowledge of Russian is not required. Each section of this course will be limited to twenty students who will be instructed by an experienced professor. Questions and discussion are strongly encouraged. This course can be used to fulfill the General Education or Bachelor of Arts Humanities requirement, the United States and International Cultures requirement, and the first-year seminar requirement. A series of short papers will train students in the skills of information gathering and written expression. The course grade will be based on oral participation and on the grade for the papers, which will be evaluated both for content and writing. This course will help to prepare students for a variety of additional courses in the fields of literature and Russian/East European area studies. In addition to the academic topic and issues of this course, students can expect to gain a general introduction to the University as an academic community and have the opportunity to explore their responsibilities as members of that community.

More specifically, we'll examine, through an historical lens, humankind's quest to describe and explain and, ultimately, to expand the diversity of the living world. We begin with early attempts to classify living things for example, Aristotle and Pliny. We then see how medieval bestiaries appropriated classical ideas about nature while adding to them in the context of Christian historia. In the Enlightenment, Linnaeus's taxonomic work provided a new way of naming and systematizing organisms. On the other hand, the nascent scientific methods of Sir Francis Bacon anticipate the shift from the descriptive to the theoretical and mechanistic that accompanied Darwin's first sketch of a phylogenetic tree and the theory of evolution. We consider new theories, methods, and language in our examination of Watson and Crick and the double helix, molecular biology, and genomics. The course concludes with a glimpse at future possibilities enabled by what was studied previously in the course: genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and de-extinction. The course's original structure offers the experiential engagement of the sciences through laboratory experiments and fieldwork along with the workshop and directed discussions characteristic of the humanities seminar.

The course also asks students to think critically about the role of science, technology, and medicine in world history and the impact of that history on today's world. Topics include: the role of scientific and technical expertise in society; the social and economic conditions that have fostered and impeded scientific development and technological innovation; the social, aesthetic, and symbolic considerations that have shaped the way scientific ideas have been framed and used; and the impact of scientific notions and technological innovations on social life. Students are required to read both primary and secondary texts. Students are also required to augment their classroom readings with scholarly material that they find through library and electronic research. In addition to regular classroom discussions, students will also participate in team-based learning activities and projects that require the students to interact with their peers and to present their thoughts publicly.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: HumanitiesGeneral Education: Humanities (GH)

The social and technological bases of various food systems are examined from the hunter-gatherer to the agrarian to the modern industrial system and its discontents. The course also considers how different types of food (e.g., meat, milk, cereals, chocolate) are preserved and distributed, examining both the effects of the development of the science and technology on society and vice versa. The roles of various food components (e.g., proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins) are examined both within the foods as determinants of quality, and also in terms of human nutrition and health. Finally, various other ways food may be considered appropriate or inappropriate will be studied including scientifically based reasons (e.g., safety, taste, adulteration) and non-scientifically based reasons (e.g., ethical, legal, religious).",3,3,Cross-listed with: FDSC 105Bachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral SciencesGeneral Education: Health and Wellness (GHW)GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking

S T S (HIST) 123 History of Science II (3) (GH) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.The purpose of this course is to explore the earliest developments in science, beginning with the prehistoric roots of technology and theories of human origins, followed by an engagement with the achievements of the Mayans, Aztecs, and native North Americans. We then turn to science and technology in the ancient Greek Egyptian worlds, followed by an analysis of early Chinese and East Indian science, medieval science in Europe, selected African sciences, and the rise of modern science in the Scientific Revolution and beyond. The point of the course is to show that science is a world tradition with an ancient history, and that many social, political, cultural, and economic forces can push or pull this peculiar form of knowing in one direction rather than another. There are other history of science courses offered at Penn State, but none treats the history of science in general in relation to its social context and influences. Other history of science courses are more thematic than survey courses (e.g., 'History of Mathematics' and 'History of Gender in Science and Archaeostronomy'). HIST 122, 'History of Science I,' treats science from Stonehenge to the scientific revolution. Students may take either course alone or out of sequence; the first will not be a prerequisite for the second. The expectation is that students will combine knowledge acquired in this course with knowledge from their required general education courses in science to develop a broader understanding of history and science. HIST/S T S 123 may be used to fulfill a requirement for the History major and the History minor and it is an essential part of the recently proposed science and technology history theme within the Science, Technology and Society minor. Students will learn historical techniques for the objective evaluation of readings and the formulation of clear and valid responses.

SOC 001S Introductory Sociology (3) (GS)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Introductory Sociology provides perspectives and information useful in understanding all societies. The major theories (functionalism, conflict, and symbolic interactionism) and concepts provide the foundation upon which the remaining material rests. Learning how sociologists do research provides the tools for understanding the production of knowledge and for evaluating the validity of sociological assertions. Familiarity with systematic theorizing and conceptual development, along with some comprehension of the nature of the scientific method as it is applied in sociology, enhances critical reasoning. To promote a more complete understanding of human social life, both in its inherent constraints and in the opportunities it provides; the nature and reality of culture and social structure are explored. The study of socialization provides perspectives on how one becomes a member of society. Exploring social interaction adds insight into the formation of the social self and the salience of group identities and norms. Ending this first section with a discussion of social control highlights the forces of stability and change in society. The course then progresses to considerations of social stratification and inequality. The nature of privilege and oppression are discussed and considered in the specific contexts of race, ethnicity, gender, and age. The focus then shifts to social institutions. The essential work of society is accomplished via its major institutions: family, education, health care, economy and work, religion, and politics. Applying theoretical perspectives to the form and function of these institutions enhances an understanding of how different social structures provide varying constraints and opportunities to their inhabitants. Finally, considering large-scale forces for change provides a platform to comprehend where human societies have been, are now, and might be headed. Throughout the course, the lectures as well as the textbook draw amply on cross-cultural and cross-national material. In addition, the course emphasizes the complexity of human social life and describes the many variables (social structural, cultural, interpersonal, and psychological) that influence behavior. A special component of the course deals with topics pertinent to the social behavior and norms of students of the ages typically taking this course. Depending on the faculty member, these topics could include sexual behavior, alcohol use, and problems in interpersonal relationships. Discussion and questions are encouraged in all sections. Sections of this course may include group research projects, debates, and library or internet-based research. Along with personal contact, students have the opportunity to communicate with teaching assistants and faculty members via e-mail.

8231,SOC 19,SOC,19,,Sociology of Popular Culture,"In this course students will be introduced to the theories, concepts, and research techniques sociologists use by applying them to study popular culture. Popular culture is pervasive in modern societies and comes in many forms both in and out of the mainstream ¿ from pop songs, TV series, and fashion trends to Manga, Burning Man, and Furries. Thanks to social media and the Internet pop culture morphs and spreads rapidly from person to person, across time and space, making it a global culture. As a scientific approach to studying the moving parts that make societies tick, sociology is well suited to helping us make sense of a topic this diverse and complex. To make the topic of pop culture more manageable for a single course, students will explore how popular culture is shaped by the social dividing lines commonly found in modern societies and in turn helps to shape how factors such as race, social class, gender, sexuality, and nationality affect people's lives. The course is organized to meet two instructional goals. First, to demonstrate to students how questions about pop culture stemming from varied sociological perspectives can be answered using different research methods. Second, to help students think sociologically about pop culture by helping them to conduct their own investigations of types and aspects of pop culture that they are curious about. Along the way the class will discuss such issues as creativity and innovation in culture production;the commercialization of popular culture; cultural capital and social distinctions; popular culture as an identity resource; the political uses of pop culture; subcultural deviance; music scenes; cultural colonialism and hybridization; YouTube stars, ""binge-watching,"" and the latest pop culture trends and developments. The hope is that by studying popular culture as part of social processes and human relationships students become more sociologically savvy observers of their cultural environment and gain a richer awareness of the significance of popular culture in their own lives. Practically speaking, the course offers students a foundation for further study in sociology and related social sciences, as well as academic and applied disciplines that focus on popular culture and other types of art and culture.",3,3,Bachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral SciencesGeneral Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)GenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think

The course focuses on the social construction of gender and the impact of gender on experiences in a variety of social contexts and institutions throughout the life course, including cross-cultural comparisons of gender expectations. An overriding objective is to help students better assess and analyze the effects of gender throughout history and in their everyday lives. Class sessions are a mixture of lectures, discussions, group exercises, guest speakers, and films designed to engage the students in the learning process. Each session helps students to critically evaluate the effects of gender discussed in their readings and experienced in their everyday lives. The evaluation tools used for this course extend this critical evaluation. Although the specific evaluation methods vary by sections, all sections use some form of reaction papers, book reviews, and/or journals. These writing assignments require students to demonstrate an understanding of the class readings, lectures, and activities, and to offer an evaluation and assessment of these readings and presentations. Because the social construction of gender is intertwined with family, work, religion, education, government, and all interpersonal interaction, the course overlaps with courses in each of these areas.

What defines moral character and how does it influence what we do? Is it possible to derive what ought to be done from what is known about the world? How do we respond when moral demands compete with another? How do our moral convictions color our perceptions of world events? Can individuals and groups with differing moral commitments communicate with one another and live together peacefully? The course integrates perspectives from philosophy, psychology, and sociology, and prepares students to think about (and act in) a world in which morality (and its linked concepts, such as judgment of others) plays an increasingly important social and political role. The course treats morality as both an aspirational concept and as an actual social practice, and focuses on three major themes: (1) the origins and development of moral reasoning and ethical systems, (2) the influence of moral emotions and moral intuitions on moral reasoning and behavior, and (3) the influence of social and contextual factors on moral behavior and expression.

Sometimes guilty parties go free and sometimes innocent people are convicted. In this course, we will employ the perspective of the social scientist to understand why and how wrongful convictions occur. How can social science help to predict, explain, and prevent wrongful convictions? This course is organized into three units. In the first unit, we will examine the large body of social science research that demonstrates disparities in all stages of the criminal justice system. For example, young Black and Latino men are disproportionately arrested, charged, convicted and imprisoned for violent crimes. This is partly due to these men disproportionately living in environments that foster crime, but social science research shows sometimes it's also partly due to the discretionary decisions of police, prosecutors, and courts. As a result, these demographic groups are most likely to be wrongfully convicted. In the second unit, we'll explore the factors in the justice system that might lead to a wrongful conviction, including false confessions, eyewitness misidentification, poor legal representation, government misconduct, and informants and snitches. Social scientific findings elucidate how each of these factors influence conviction accuracy. Finally, we'll discuss how social science research on the risks and factors that contribute to wrongful convictions can be used to improve policies to reduce the risk of such convictions. Simple reforms such as openness about plea-bargaining, eyewitness identification reform (e.g., sequential lineups, double-blind procedures, etc.), recording of interrogations, and introducing Innocence Commissions in every state can improve our criminal justice system.",3,3,Cross-listed with: CRIM 201General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)GenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Key LiteraciesGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason

The focus of the course will be on reading and interpreting visual images (painting, photography, film, illustration, digital media) and analyzing the larger social and cultural forces that shape the production, distribution and consumption of these media forms. We will explore these issues by focusing on a series of images/case studies located in a specific historical context, allowing us to introduce some of the major movements in visual culture, explore the social contexts of these images, and the ways in which the visual experience shapes our social lives and personal identities. Course evaluations will include exams, writing assignments, a class blog, and a final art project. The course examines visual representations of cultures over time, providing students with the artistic, historical, political and sociological context of their production. This integrative framework will enable students to understand how the creation of visual media and its interpretations both influence and are influenced by social context. It will introduce students to integrative thinking by providing them with interpretive techniques of the social sciences and the arts to increase their powers of visual analysis so that they can discuss an image's medium, composition, style and iconography. The course will examine the ways that the arts can be an expression of cultural values, helping students to comprehend the hegemonic aspects of image composition, production, exhibition and distribution.

The lectures will cover the nature, causes and consequence of health inequality, temporal trends and spatial patterns in health indicators, and examine associations between socioeconomic and environmental factors and health. The emphasis will be on easily measured and available primary health indicators such as mortality and morbidity, communicable and non-communicable disease as well as mental health. The lab component of the course will focus on finding, critiquing, interpreting and presenting health-related data and will introduce students to fundamental concepts and expand their skill set in both basic statistics (numerical and graphical skills) and mapping (geographic visualization skills). At the end of the course the students will be more familiar with measures of human health and a variety of international and US data resources. The lecture component begins with focus on describing and understanding past, present and future patterns and trends in human health, examining these at the global, national (US), regional (Appalachia) and local (Pennsylvania) scales. The second half of the course includes lectures on the social determinants of health, the ways in which the legal landscape and direct and indirect discriminatory practices can influence health and wellbeing (e.g., around reproductive health, sexuality, and risk-taking behaviors), mental health, and the geographies of access to resources and the geography of exposure to risks. The final lecture will discuss 21st century ""Global"" health challenges. The parallel lecture and labs provide opportunities for practical learning. The labs are designed to expose students to the use of health data, geographic information systems and basic spatial analysis tools providing them with skills that help them to accurately summarize and report data on health outcomes. Students will learn how to find, critique and use data appropriately to measure and map health outcomes. The labs will be based on sample data sets and case studies that draw on the use and interpretation of a variety of data sets, international, national, and sub-national.

You will study discourse and rhetoric by examining the stories you hear from others and you will learn to develop your own story-telling abilities. You will engage in this process through participating in cross-cultural conversations twice weekly with your international and domestic peers at Penn State. All dialogues, both through in-class training and practicum, will revolve around both U.S. and international themes, which will often invite conflict and disagreement, as well as political divides and historical legacies. In class, you will learn a set of practices that will allow you to directly engage with these divergent perspectives, and you will practice applying them directly to your dialogues. This course includes 1.5 hours of weekly class time and 3 hours in a weekly course practicum, in which you will use your position as dialogue ""participator"" (an activated participant) along with your foundational communication skills (introduced in class) to develop and test hypotheses about people, culture, and social conflict according to a Grounded Theory approach. Some of the specific skills you will learn during the will be: designing and delivering open-ended questions, listening actively reflectively, as well as techniques for collaborating with facilitators to co-construct a conversational environment for ""thinking together.",1,4,Bachelor of Arts: Other CulturesBachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral SciencesInternational Cultures (IL)United States Cultures (US)General Education: Social and Behavioral Scien (GS)GenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning

In this course, you will learn to recognize the foundational sociological forces that shape human interaction on the family, community, societal, and global levels, and you will understand the essential role of facilitators in rebalancing these forces. You will discover what it means to ""think together across borders,"" and you will have opportunities to think together with ""participators"" from a multiplicity of social positions, examining and exploring the cultural and structural forces that shape your own and others' perspectives. In this course you will begin to examine your assumptions about US cultures, values, and traditions in relation to global communities around the world. The course includes an embedded practicum, during which you will develop a unique set of communication practices that allow you to effectively lead a small group, cross-cultural dialogue. So you will attend class 4 hours per week and then co-facilitate at least two (and sometimes three) 90-minute dialogues weekly with other students who are enrolled in the class. The participators of these dialogues will be other Penn State students who register for World in Conversation dialogues as well as students who are enrolled at universities around the world (using VTC technology). You will be provided with live coaching and direct feedback to support your development. Some of the specific skills you will learn during the in-class component of the course will be how to create a conversational environment for ""thinking together"", engaged Socratic inquiry, asking open-ended questions, active reflective listening, techniques for disrupting communication patterns, and working with a partner facilitator. In this course you will learn to see and think as a facilitator. You will develop the ability to ""seek truth"" in relationship to complex social issues by inviting a multiplicity of perspectives to be explored and how to work with and navigate both debate and dialogue. You will understand the elements that make a dialogue more than just an exchange of ideas, and you will learn to excavate the complex mindsets and worldviews of ""participators"" that bring nuance and thoughtful inquiry into topics that are often divisive (and thus, examined too simplistically). By the end of this course, you will be proficient in all of the key mindsets and communication practices of a dialogue facilitator.",3,4,Bachelor of Arts: Social and Behavioral SciencesInternational Cultures (IL)United States Cultures (US)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning

JST 457 / ANTH 457 / SOC 457 Jewish Communities: Identity, Survival, and Transformation in Unexpected Places (3) (US;IL) This course addresses an understudied aspect of Jewish experience. It aims to expand our understanding of Jewish communities by focusing on those that are, alternatively, small, situated in out-of-the-way places, culturally outside the Jewish urban mainstream, or embedded in a larger society with markedly different values and traditions. These communities often constitute the points-of-contact between Jews and non-Jews, and in so doing sometimes transform Jews, non-Jews, and the relationships among them. Other such communities constitute experiments in Jewish lifeways and provide mainstream Jews with pilot projects for potential social and cultural change. This course will explore the significance of small, little-known, idiosyncratic, and anomalous Jewish communities on Jewish history and culture, and draw on them to instruct students on the social and cultural processes of small or unusual communities generally. The communities studied will be located both in the U.S. and elsewhere in which Jews have lived as a minority community during modern times. The course will look at the founding, growth, and decline of such communities and at their social processes and institutions. It will explore how to understand and analyze such communities, which vary from one part of the world to another. The social world of Jewish communities, large and small, is a core interest of Penn State's Jewish Studies Program. This course will complement the current offerings in Jewish Studies, strengthening the social, cultural, and contemporary perspectives available in the Program. It will provide students with an opportunity to explore individual experience and micro-level processes among Jews, and to study the dynamics of identity and survival. It will complement the current offerings in Sociology and Anthropology by affording an opportunity to focus on community-level social processes and by adding a course on contemporary Jewry. The course will integrate knowledge from a variety of sources and fields, promote intercultural understanding, and meet US and IL requirements. Materials will be interdisciplinary, and will include ethnographies, sociological studies, population studies, histories, and personal narratives. They will include primary texts, creative works, and scholarly analyses. The assignments will be structured to facilitate preliminary experience in independent analysis, library research, or field research. The course will be offered approximately once a year.

SWENG 452W Embedded Real Time Systems (3) Real time operating systems is the study of hardware/software systems in which timing constraints must be met for correctness. Real time systems are embedded in applications ranging from the antilock brakes in cars to the flight control systems for jetliners. Students are first introduced to the concept of systems with real time constraints by examining case studies. The unified modeling languages (UML) with real time extension is introduced allowing students to capture the constraints present in the systems in a variety of models allowing the problem to be described at several levels of abstraction. Tasks and messages are introduced as programming structures which can satisfy the constraints described by the UML models. With a basic understanding of real time systems and how to implement them, the focus of the course shifts away from these technical concerns towards understanding the documentation of the requirements using the Volere Requirements Specification template. All the writing assignments in the class will revolve around Volere in one way or another. Increasingly complex case studies will give the class the opportunity to explore more sophisticated inter-task communications mechanisms as well as common pitfalls present in RTOS applications. Students will learn how to verify the correctness of their applications in order to guarantee that the real time constraints can be met when the system is deployed. Discussion will turn to application programmer interfaces used by hardware vendors to port hardware into a RTOS. The class will end by designing and building a complex RTOS by a team of students using the techniques learned in the class. The project will outline the needs of the RTOS application in a project proposal using the Volere template. The proposal will be developed iteratively with the faculty member until its scope and definition are clear.

8342,SOILS 71,SOILS,71,,Environmental Sustainability,"This class provides an introduction to environmental sustainability for students with no background in environmental science or soils. The concept of sustainability provides a framework for understanding environmental problems by balancing the needs of current society with the long-term needs of future societies and the environment. Sustainability also provides a framework for linking international cultures because environmental problems and solutions often cross political and cultural boundaries. The goal of the course is to develop critical thinking skills related to sustainable environmental choices. As we explore the concept of sustainability, we will discover the role of soil in mediating human-environment interactions by determining natural plant and animal abundance, supporting agriculture, and buffering the environment against modern pollution. The four themes of the class are: 1) Environment, Sustainability and Natural Resources, which introduces students to the scientific method and value systems that affect environmental choices, to fundamental ecological principles and to basic concepts of soil science and environmental science, 2) Challenges to Sustainability, in which we consider some of the major challenges to global sustainability; climate change, loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, human population growth and resource consumption and waste management, 3) Feeding the World and its Impact on the Environment in which we consider the Malthusian dilemma of how we can feed ~10 billion of people in the near future together with the conservation dilemma of how we can maintain a healthy environment, and 4) Sustainability Solutions, in which we consider what has been done to achieve environmental protection while sustainably increasing food production and students are challenged to develop their own sustainability solution to a current issue somewhere in the world. The class will include ""soils cases"" in which examples from environmental soil science are used to convey principles of sustainability, and ""sustainability activities"" to see examples of sustainable environmental choices on campus or in State College. Students will complete the class with: 1) a survey of the key issues in global environmental sustainability, 2) exposure to current scientific information related to these issues, 3) an enhanced ability to interpret environmental data, 4) an increased knowledge of the role of soils in maintaining environmental quality, 5) an increased understanding of how environmental problems and solutions are global phenomena, requiring cooperation among many international cultures, and 6) a significant depth of knowledge about ""what it takes"" to feed 10 billion people while maintaining a healthy environment.",3,3,General Education:  Natural Sciences (GN)GenEd Learning Objective: Global LearningGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Key LiteraciesGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason

This same nutrient behavior is linked to the fate of nutrients either applied as sources of plant nutrition or through disposal of nutrient containing materials on soils, which is a major environmental issue. Management practices necessary to minimize environmental impacts from nutrients are also covered. From this background students will be able to understand nutrient behavior and management recommendations and adapt management to a variety of soil-plant systems and situations both for plant growth and environmental protection. Real world examples of developing and adapting management systems are used to illustrate this process.

The aim is to characterize integrated physical, chemical, and biological processes of soil-water interactions across scales (including chemicals and energy transported by water flow). This course embraces interdisciplinary and multiscale studies of interactive pedological and hydrological processes in the earth's surface and subsurface environments. The course will address the fundamental issues and practical applications of hydropedology (as a sister discipline of hydrogeology). This course emphasizesin situsoils that have distinct characteristics of pedogenic features, structures, layers, and soil-landscape relationships in the real world. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of soil and water interactions across scales from point observations to watershed phenomena, and will gain skills in predicting flow pathways and water fluxes in the landscape. This course promotes active learning, critical thinking, and hands-on skills. Course format will consist of two lectures and one laboratory/field exercise each week. The course will utilize a network of local watersheds with different land uses for demonstrations and class projects. Grading will be based on weekly lab/field exercise (20%), class research project (40%), homework (10%), one midterm exams (15%), and one final exam (15%). Since hydropedology is linked to a wide array of environmental, ecological, geological, agricultural, and natural resource issues of societal importance, SOILS (GEOSC) 405 will support interdisciplinary training of students in Soil Science as well as in other disciplines of the College of Agricultural Sciences, especially Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Agronomy, and Forest Resources.

SOILS 422 provides the student with practical knowledge of community and natural resources conservation. The course covers symbiotic aspects of soil, water, air, plants, animals, and humans and their impact on the community. The course focuses on developing methods for the conservation and sustainable use of resources. This involves understanding the land ethic and developing a sense of place. Conservation awareness has grown in recent years. Originally, erosion control was the sole reason for conservation planning. Eventually water conservation also became a concern addressed by planning. We have now moved into an era of ecosystem-based planning, where soil health, water and air quality, sustainable communities, and much more are considered in conservation planning. This planning involves both natural and human resources. SOILS 422 covers understanding, designing, and developing best management practices (BMPs) for addressing resource conservation and maintaining sustainable farmland and communities. Calculating runoff and soil loss are researched and integrated into conservation planning as tools for establishing the need for BMPs. Resources and technologies are covered, such as soil surveys, geographic information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS), and ground penetrating radar (GPR). Networking and partnerships are also covered to give the student a practical knowledge of the critical nature of teamwork. Additionally, workings and interactions between federal, state, and local organizations and agencies are explored. Land-use patterns, such as urban and suburban sprawl, mining, logging, and resource utilization are explored. Education is enhanced in the form of a community/sense of place project. This project utilizes classroom knowledge and incorporates student research into a practical plan for developing an appreciation and awareness for one's community. Throughout the course the various aspects of soil, water, air, plants, animals and humans are woven together to emphasize the importance of all decisions on the ecosystem. After completing SOILS 422, the student will be equipped to make valuable and educated decisions to positively affect the community. Hands-on aspects of the course include various field trips to experience field conservation and community stability. At the end of the course the student will be able to evaluate effects of human activities on the landscape; make sustainable landuse decisions; determine the need for, and design best management practices; and develop a sense of place and describe individual roles and responsibilities in the community.",4,4,Prerequisite: SOILS 101

The course emphasizes modern and contemporary contexts of gender/religion debates, introducing feminist historical methods in order to trace the origins and trajectories of today's controversies. Students should expect to gain a comparative historical perspective on at least three theological traditions. Possible topics include: history of gender and religious practices; femininities and masculinities in a spiritual context; the flesh and the spiritual body; and sexuality, and both ethical and theological approaches to theories of gender, feminism, and identity. We will explore ways in which religious teachings, in both historical and contemporary contexts, inform secular understandings of gender and the ways in which contemporary conceptions of gender inform religious practice. While religion plays a crucial role in defining sex and gender norms, changing sex and gender norms can pressure the doctrine, discourses, practices and organizational structures of faith institutions, some established centuries or millennia ago. The course considers not only the roles of women and men, or constructions of masculinity and femininity, but also the impacts of non-binary genders and sexualities that may be acceptable (even celebrated) in some religions and shunned in others. We will address urgent and perennial questions from different religious perspectives: what is the spiritual meaning of sexuality? Is sexuality an obstacle or a vehicle for spiritual fulfillment? Who are the voices of authority who set the sacred rules on sexuality and who gets to enforce them? How do we (or should we) balance the tensions of non-aligned government and religious concerns, as in contemporary debates around same-sex marriage; abortion and reproductive rights; legal definitions of ""family""; the Muslim veil in secular contexts; divorce; trans rights; attitudes toward the body; gender mutilation and/or sex-reassignment surgery; sexual violence towards women, gay, and trans individuals around the world; child and sexual abuse among the clergy; and religious leadership and inclusion.

We will explore the complex, and oftentimes contradictory, meanings attached to gender and sexuality in various African contexts. For example, what does it mean to be a ""good"" woman in Uganda today? How does this definition change (or not) if she comes out as a lesbian? What if s/he identifies as a transgender man or rejects gender binaries altogether? What if gender did not matter, or even, did not exist? In addition to exploring these types of questions, we will also examine African feminist thought, paying close attention to the ways in which African feminisms are similar to and/or different from other forms of feminism worldwide. We will also consider what these movements looked like in practice. What strategies did African feminists utilize to promote social change? What challenges did they face? What victories resulted from their efforts? Although topics may vary from semester to semester, key themes include environmental activism, anti-war/peace activism, political activism, sex worker rights activism, activism to support peoples living with HIV/AIDS, and activism against harmful traditional practices. Finally, we will examine the ways in which African feminists have contributed to global debates and initiatives on women's rights and gender equity.

8876,WMNST 245,WMNST,245,,Introduction to LGBTQ Studies,"An introduction to the dominant themes in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies, with an emphasis on both literary & cultural studies. This course explores the history of modern, western ideas about sexual identity as manifested in literature, theater, film, and other narrative forms of popular culture. Drawing on the substantial body of ""queer theory"" generated by scholars in the humanities since the 1990s, this class examines sexuality not as a ""natural"" or consistent phenomenon, but as a set of beliefs that have changed over time and manifest themselves differently in different cultural and historical contexts. Starting in the late nineteenth century, scientific and medical authorities began categorizing individuals into sexual types based on their manifestations of gendered characteristics and their erotic attractions and practices. This medical typing corresponded with the development of subcultures associated with deviance from sexual norms; these subcultures produced a rich variety of texts, images, performances, and social forms, many of which became central to both popular and high culture. This course explores this rich archive, moving among media. It investigates constructions of sexual conformity and how sexual nonconformists positioned themselves in relation to cultural and medical group identities. It examines how distinctions between gendered, raced, and classed bodies were historically produced and culturally contested. It considers what commonalities gay identities may - or may not -- share with lesbian identities and how transgender and other identities have altered perceptions of sexual identity. The course also explores the relationship of the avant-garde to the mass media and how sexual subcultures have shaped literary and other cultural forms of expression. Comparative study of issues of sexual mobility beyond and between the borders of the United States expands the course's critical scope beyond dominant forms of western culture. This course does not propose definitive answers to the questions of identity it addresses. Instead it negotiates the ways sexualities have enabled individuals to articulate -- and disarticulate -- themselves within social bodies past and present. This course, therefore, has wide relevance for students interested in how group identities come into being and transform over time in dynamic relation to other historical forces. Exploring a wide variety of cultural forms associated with the history of sexual identity as well as a variety of interpretations of that history, this course opens students to an archive of literature, theater, film, and other narrative arts with the potential to inform and enrich their understandings of many kinds of challenges to regimes of normativity today.",3,3,Cross-listed with: ENGL 245United States Cultures (US)General Education: Humanities (GH)GenEd Learning Objective: Effective CommunicationGenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical ThinkGenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingGenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason

AFAM 303 / ANTH 303 / WMNST 303 Race and Gender in the Americas: Latin American and Caribbean Cultures (3) (GS;IL) Utilizing a theoretical framework of interesectionaly this course examines how racial, gender, sexual, and class identities are constructed in Latin American/Caribbean societies. The course applies an anthropological perspective to a wide range of countries in the region to reflect on how historical events such as the conquest, colonization, slavery, and independence movements are relevant to understanding the region today, as well as how race, gender, and sexuality inform contemporary themes of empire, nation-building, imperialism, neo-colonialism, revolution, violence, militarization, social movements, religion, neoliberalism, U.S. involvement/relations, and popular culture. The course addresses issues of power, culture, racial formation, and citizenship by incorporating interdisciplinary material beyond ethnography such as newspapers, grassroots media, biographies, films, music, novels, personal testimonies, etc. Rooted in feminist anthropological scholarship, this course emphasizes how power (from above and below) and culture mediate relationships between individual/community agency and institutions/structures. As an effort to encourage students to think about Anthropology and culture beyond superficial or romanticizing celebrations of multiculturalism, food, and music, the course stresses the theoretical importance of situating power and privilege amidst difference. We conceptualize culture not only as socially transmitted patterns of behavior and ideas/meanings, but as a complex and dynamic process/medium grounded in unequal relations in which power is constituted and resisted. The ethnographic emphasis of the course centers on the complex lived realities and voices of people, encouraging students to learn, understand, and respect cultural difference. The course offers students a broad sense of how power is central in the production of knowledge (particularly within the disciplines of Anthropology and History). Students will critically engage an array of topical issues in Latin America beyond dichotomous thinking. Discussion of course material includes contemplating issues of ethics, subjectivity, bias, and privilege. Conversations regarding processes of ""Othering"" and traditional ""us vs. them"" debates that often occur when discussing developing countries will prompt students to situate their own power/privilege and challenge our assumptions and preconceived notions of Latin America. Moreover, this course teaches Latin American Cultures within a global context of racialization. As such it also stresses the historical and contemporary social, economic, cultural and political significance of the U.S. in Latin America, to demonstrate how we are connected and responsible to what happens ""over there.""; In order to promote service learning, a core tenant of feminist pedagogy, this course also offers students the opportunity to participate in an optional embedded program entitled ""Cuba: Identity, Diversity and Popular Culture"".

Readings and discussions are organized around three main learning units: 1) Approaches to Gender in Development; 2) Gender, Work, and Identity in the Global Economy; and 3) Rights, Reproduction and the Body. Particular attention will be paid to representations of women and men by Western organizations acting in the name of Feminism and/or Development, and to the responses of feminist communities in the South to these portrayals. In studying these issues, we will resist the tendency to conflate ""gender"" with ""women"", instead looking comprehensively at the identities, rights, and lived experiences of diverse gendered identities. We will carefully consider differences using an intersectional frame that considers social factors such as sexuality, race, economic class, and legal status.

The course incorporates approaches from cultural, postcolonial, subaltern, queer, gender, and critical race studies, all of which have influenced current debates across the field of geography. Feminist scholars have long been concerned with the spatial politics of cultural difference. As a point of entry to discussions of gender and geography, this course will explore the diverse ways in which geographers have conceived of, analyzed, and redefined gender as a contested spatial practice that intersects with other facets of identity such as race, class, and sexuality. Using contemporary geographic texts, we will explore the gendered dynamics of geographic research, citizenship, violence, security, nationalism, nature,and globalization. The purpose of this course is to examine how gender is understood and utilized in the field of geography. This course also aims to enhance students' ability to engage in first-hand critical research, as well as collaborative learning, through a reflective and on-going process of research and writing over the course of the semester.
